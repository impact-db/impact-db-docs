Growing E. coli to high cell densityâa historical perspective on method development,"J Shiloach, R Fass",Biotechnology advances,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2005.04.004,"E. coli is the major bacterial platform for expressing simple heterologous proteins. Growing E. coli to high densities has been the subject of numerous studies since the early 1970s, exploring the limits of bacterial culture density in order to achieve maximum productivity. Research strategies were focused on improving the cultivation techniques, manipulating the bacteria's physiology or both. As a result, batch, fed batch and dialysis fermentation techniques had been developed. These growth strategies, together with optimization of media composition and the application of molecular biology methods, made it possible to grow E. coli to cell densities of up to 190 g/l (dry weight), while avoiding media precipitation and preventing acetate accumulation. Additional research on the effects of heterologous protein biosynthesis on signal transduction, proteolysis and post transcription events in E. coli may improve its productivity."
Efficient production of indigoidine in Escherichia coli,"Xu, F., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-015-1642-5,"Indigoidine is a bacterial natural product with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Its bright blue color resembles the industrial dye indigo, thus representing a new natural blue dye that may find uses in industry. In our previous study, an indigoidine synthetase Sc-IndC and an associated helper protein Sc-IndB were identified from Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982 and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BAP1 to produce the blue pigment at 3.93 g/l. To further improve the production of indigoidine, in this work, the direct biosynthetic precursor L-glutamine was fed into the fermentation broth of the engineered E. coli strain harboring Sc-IndC and Sc-IndB. The highest titer of indigoidine reached 8.81 +/- 0.21 g/l at 1.46 g/l L-glutamine. Given the relatively high price of L-glutamine, a metabolic engineering technique was used to directly enhance the in situ supply of this precursor. A glutamine synthetase gene (glnA) was amplified from E. coli and co-expressed with Sc-indC and Sc-indB in E. coli BAP1, leading to the production of indigoidine at 5.75 +/- 0.09 g/l. Because a nitrogen source is required for amino acid biosynthesis, we then tested the effect of different nitrogen-containing salts on the supply of L-glutamine and subsequent indigoidine production. Among the four tested salts including (NH4)2SO4, NH4Cl, (NH4)2HPO4 and KNO3, (NH4)2HPO4 showed the best effect on improving the titer of indigoidine. Different concentrations of (NH4)2HPO4 were added to the fermentation broths of E. coli BAP1/Sc-IndC+Sc-IndB+GlnA, and the titer reached the highest (7.08 +/- 0.11 g/l) at 2.5 mM (NH4)2HPO4. This work provides two efficient methods for the production of this promising blue pigment in E. coli."
Engineering of high yield production of Lâserine in Escherichia coli,K Schneider,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.25844,"L-serine is a widely used amino acid that has been proposed as a potential building block biochemical. The high theoretical yield from glucose makes a fermentation based production attractive. In order to achieve this goal, serine degradation to pyruvate and glycine in E. coli MG1655 was prevented by deletion of three L-serine deaminases sdaA, sdaB, and tdcG, as well as serine hydroxyl methyl transferase (SHMT) encoded by glyA. Upon overexpression of the serine production pathway, consisting of a feedback resistant version of serA along with serB and serC, this quadruple deletion strain showed a very high serine production yield (0.45âg/g glucose) during small-scale batch fermentation in minimal medium. Serine, however, was found to be highly toxic even at low concentrations to this strain, which lead to slow growth and production during fed batch fermentation, resulting in a serine production of 8.3âg/L. The production strain was therefore evolved by random mutagenesis to achieve increased tolerance towards serine. Additionally, overexpression of eamA, a cysteine/homoserine transporter was demonstrated to increase serine tolerance from 1.6âg/L to 25âg/L. During fed batch fermentation, the resulting strain lead to the serine production titer of 11.7âg/L with yield of 0.43âg/g glucose, which is the highest yield reported so far for any organism.

Susceptibility ofEscherichia coli to C2-C18 fatty acids,V Rada,Folia Microbiologica,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02931506,"The antimicrobial activity of C2âC18 fatty acids was determinedin vitro in cultures of two strains ofEscherichia coli grown on glucose. Antimicrobial activity was expressed as IC50 (a concentration at which only 50 % of the initial glucose in the cultures was utilized). Utilization of glucose was inhibited by caprylic acid (IC50 0.30â0.85 g/L) and capric acid (IC50 1.25â2.03 g/L). Neither short-chain fatty acids (C2âC6) nor fatty acids with longer chain (C12âC18) influenced substrate utilization. Caproic acid, however, decreased cell yield in cultures ofE. coli in a dose-dependent manner. No inhibition of glucose utilization was produced with unsaturated fatty acids, oleic and linoleic. Calcium ions added in excess reversed the antimicrobial effect of capric acid, but not that of caprylic acid. Antimicrobial activity of caprylic and capric acid decreased when the bacteria were grown in the presence of straw particles, or repeatedly subcultured in a medium containing these compounds at low concentrations. Counts of viable bacteria determined by plating decreased after incubation with caprylic and capric acid (30 min; 1 g/L) at pH 5.2 from >109 to â102/mL. A reduction of a mere 0.94â1.96 log10 CFU was observed at pH 6.5â6.6. It can be concluded that caprylic acid, and to a lesser extent also capric acid, has a significant antimicrobial activity towardE. coli. Effects of other fatty acids were not significant or absent."
In silico design and adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli for production of lactic acid,"Fong, S. S., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.20542,"The development and validation of new methods to help direct rational strain design for metabolite overproduction remains an important problem in metabolic engineering. Here we show that computationally predicted E. coli strain designs, calculated from a genome-scale metabolic model, can lead to successful production strains and that adaptive evolution of the engineered strains can lead to improved production capabilities. Three strain designs for lactate production were implemented yielding a total of 11 evolved production strains that were used to demonstrate the utility of this integrated approach. Strains grown on 2 g/L glucose at 37 degrees C showed lactate titers ranging from 0.87 to 1.75 g/L and secretion rates that were directly coupled to growth rates."
Biosynthesis of ethylene glycol in Escherichia coli,"Liu, H., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4618-7,"Ethylene glycol (EG) is an important platform chemical with steadily expanding global demand. Its commercial production is currently limited to fossil resources no biosynthesis route has been delineated. Herein, a biosynthesis route for EG production from D-xylose is reported. This route consists of four steps: D-xylose --> D-xylonate --> 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate --> glycoaldehyde --> EG. Respective enzymes, D-xylose dehydrogenase, D-xylonate dehydratase, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate aldolase, and glycoaldehyde reductase, were assembled. The route was implemented in a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli, in which the D-xylose --> D-xylulose reaction was prevented by disrupting the D-xylose isomerase gene. The most efficient construct produced 11.7 g L(-1) of EG from 40.0 g L(-1) of D-xylose. Glycolate is a carbon-competing by-product during EG production in E. coli blockage of glycoaldehyde --> glycolate reaction was also performed by disrupting the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase, but from this approach, EG productivity was not improved but rather led to D-xylonate accumulation. To channel more carbon flux towards EG than the glycolate pathway, further systematic metabolic engineering and fermentation optimization studies are still required to improve EG productivity."
Systematic engineering for high-yield production of viridiflorol and amorphadiene in auxotrophic Escherichia coli,"Shukal, S., et al.",Metab Eng,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.07.007,"Isoprenoids, widely used as pharmaceuticals, flavors and nutraceuticals, represent one of the largest groups of natural products. Yet the low availability of top-quality (enantiopure) products and high cost limit the wide application of many valuable terpenoids. An example being viridiflorol, currently used in cosmetics and personal care products, may have other unexplored applications (e.g. as insect repellents anti-inflammatory supplements). Here, we systematically optimized an auxotrophic Escherichia coli to produce viridiflorol with transcription, translation, enzyme and strain engineering. The best strain achieved 25.7â¯g/L and a yield of 0.22â¯g-viridiflorol/g-glucose in 2.5 days. Statistical analysis revealed the correlation between viridiflorol yields with the transcriptional levels and translation initiation rates, which enabled better understanding of the isoprenoid pathway and guiding future strain optimization. As a proof-of-concept example, we applied the knowledge to amorphadiene, anti-malaria drug artemisinin precursor, achieved 30â¯g/L. Hence, this study paved the way for commercialization of microbial terpenoid production."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of 5-aminovalerate and glutarate as C5 platform chemicals,"SJ Park, YH Oh",Metabolic engineering,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2012.11.011,"5-Aminovalerate (5AVA) is the precursor of valerolactam, a potential building block for producing nylon 5, and is a C5 platform chemical for synthesizing 5-hydroxyvalerate, glutarate, and 1,5-pentanediol. Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for the production of 5-aminovalerate (5AVA) and glutarate. When the recombinant E. coli WL3110 strain expressing the Pseudomonas putida davAB genes encoding delta-aminovaleramidase and lysine 2-monooxygenase, respectively, were cultured in a medium containing 20 g/L of glucose and 10 g/L of l-lysine, 3.6 g/L of 5AVA was produced by converting 7 g/L of l-lysine. When the davAB genes were introduced into recombinant E. coli strainXQ56allowing enhanced l-lysine synthesis, 0.27 and 0.5 g/L of 5AVA were produced directly from glucose by batch and fed-batch cultures, respectively. Further conversion of 5AVA into glutarate could be demonstrated by expression of the P. putida gabTD genes encoding 5AVA aminotransferase and glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. When recombinant E. coli WL3110 strain expressing the davAB and gabTD genes was cultured in a medium containing 20 g/L glucose, 10 g/L l-lysine and 10 g/L Î±-ketoglutarate, 1.7 g/L of glutarate was produced."
Engineering Escherichia coli for the High-Titer Biosynthesis of Lacto-N-tetraose,"Hu, M., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02423,"Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), a member of the human milk oligosaccharides family, has received widespread attention because of its importance in infant health. We constructed a whole-cell biotransformation method in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) for high-titer LNT synthesis. The approach was performed by using a systematic design and metabolic engineering based on the metabolic pathway of LNT. The lgtA (encoding beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) and wbgO (encoding beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase) genes were introduced into the engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) to construct an LNT-producing starting strain B1 (0.22 g/L). Then, the genes related to the LNT metabolic pathway were screened in two vectors to evaluate LNT synthesis. The lgtA-wbgO and galE-galT-galK genes were overexpressed through the two-plasmid system in E. coli BL21(DE3). The titer of LNT (3.42 g/L) had a gain of 14.55 times compared with that of B1. Furthermore, the ugd gene, which was associated with the UDP-Gal bypass pathway, was inactivated to further improve LNT production in shake-flask cultivation (4.14 g/L). The final fed-batch cultivation of the engineered strain produced 31.56 g/L of LNT. This study provided a strategy for the effective production of LNT in E. coli."
L-Tyrosine production by deregulated strains of Escherichia coli,"T LÃ¼tke-Eversloh, G Stephanopoulos",Applied microbiology and Biotechnology,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-006-0792-9,"The excretion of the aromatic amino acid L-tyrosine was achieved by manipulating three gene targets in the wild-type Escherichia coli K12: The feedback-inhibition-resistant (fbr) derivatives of aroG and tyrA were expressed on a low-copy-number vector, and the TyrR-mediated regulation of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis was eliminated by deleting the tyrR gene. The generation of this L-tyrosine producer, strain T1, was based only on the deregulation of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway, but no structural genes in the genome were affected. A second tyrosine over-producing strain, E. coli T2, was generated considering the possible limitation of precursor substrates. To enhance the availability of the two precursor substrates phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, the ppsA and the tktA genes were over-expressed in the strain T1 background, increasing L-tyrosine production by 80% in 50-ml batch cultures. Fed-batch fermentations revealed that L-tyrosine production was tightly correlated with cell growth, exhibiting the maximum productivity at the end of the exponential growth phase. The final L-tyrosine concentrations were 3.8 g/l for E. coli T1 and 9.7 g/l for E. coli T2 with a yield of L-tyrosine per glucose of 0.037 g/g (T1) and 0.102 g/g (T2), respectively."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli W3110 to produce Lâmalate,X Chen,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.26190,"A four-carbon dicarboxylic acid L-malate has recently attracted attention due to its potential applications in the fields of medicine and agriculture. In this study, Escherichia coli W3110 was engineered and optimized for L-malate production via one-step L-malate synthesis pathway. First, deletion of the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), pyruvate oxidase (poxB), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB), phosphotransacetylase (pta), and acetate kinase A (ackA) in pta-ackA pathway led to accumulate 20.9âg/L pyruvate. Then, overexpression of NADP+-dependent malic enzyme C490S mutant in this multi-deletion mutant resulted in the direct conversion of pyruvate into L-malate (3.62âg/L). Next, deletion of the genes responsible for succinate biosynthesis further enhanced L-malate production up to 7.78âg/L. Finally, L-malate production was elevated to 21.65âg/L with the L-malate yield to 0.36âg/g in a 5âL bioreactor by overexpressing the pos5 gene encoding NADH kinase in the engineered E. coli F0931 strain. This study demonstrates the potential utility of one-step pathway for efficient L-malate production. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2017;114: 656â664. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Escherichia coli âTatExpressâ strains export several g/L human growth hormone to the periplasm by the Tat pathway,M Allen,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27147,"Escherichia coli is a heavily used platform for the production of biotherapeutic and other high-value proteins, and a favored strategy is to export the protein of interest to the periplasm to simplify downstream processing and facilitate disulfide bond formation. The Sec pathway is the standard means of transporting the target protein but it is unable to transport complex or rapidly folding proteins because the Sec system can only transport proteins in an unfolded state. The Tat system also operates to transport proteins to the periplasm, and it has significant potential as an alternative means of recombinant protein production because it transports fully folded proteins. Here, we have tested the Tat system's full potential for the production of biotherapeutics for the first time using fed-batch fermentation. We expressed human growth hormone (hGH) with a Tat signal peptide in E. coli W3110 âTatExpressâ strains that contain elevated levels of the Tat apparatus. This construct contained four amino acids from TorA at the hGH N-terminus as well as the initiation methionine from hGH, which is removed in vivo. We show that the protein is efficiently exported to the periplasm during extended fed-batch fermentation, to the extent that it is by far the most abundant protein in the periplasm. The protein was shown to be homogeneous, disulfide bonded, and active. The bioassay showed that the yields of purified periplasmic hGH are 5.4âg/L culture whereas an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave a figure of 2.39âg/L. Separate analysis of a TorA signal peptide linked to hGH construct lacking any additional amino acids likewise showed efficient export to the periplasm, although yields were approximately two-fold lower."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of fumaric acid,"Song, C. W., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.24868,"Fumaric acid is a naturally occurring organic acid that is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Fungal species belonging to Rhizopus have traditionally been employed for the production of fumaric acid. In this study, Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for the production of fumaric acid under aerobic condition. For the aerobic production of fumaric acid, the iclR gene was deleted to redirect the carbon flux through the glyoxylate shunt. In addition, the fumA, fumB, and fumC genes were also deleted to enhance fumaric acid formation. The resulting strain was able to produce 1.45 g/L of fumaric acid from 15 g/L of glucose in flask culture. Based on in silico flux response analysis, this base strain was further engineered by plasmid-based overexpression of the native ppc gene, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC), from the strong tac promoter, which resulted in the production of 4.09 g/L of fumaric acid. Additionally, the arcA and ptsG genes were deleted to reinforce the oxidative TCA cycle flux, and the aspA gene was deleted to block the conversion of fumaric acid into L-aspartic acid. Since it is desirable to avoid the use of inducer, the lacI gene was also deleted. To increase glucose uptake rate and fumaric acid productivity, the native promoter of the galP gene was replaced with the strong trc promoter. Fed-batch culture of the final strain CWF812 allowed production of 28.2 g/L fumaric acid in 63 h with the overall yield and productivity of 0.389 g fumaric acid/g glucose and 0.448 g/L/h, respectively. This study demonstrates the possibility for the efficient production of fumaric acid by metabolically engineered E. coli."
Improved L-threonine production of Escherichia coli mutant by optimization of culture conditions,"Lee, M. H., et al.",J Biosci Bioeng,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.1263/jbb.101.127,"L-threonine production was investigated in a minimal salt medium using L-threonine-overproducing Escherichia coli MT201, derived from E. coli K-12. It was observed that dry cell weight reached 12.5 g/l with 15.9 g/lL-threonine. To increase dry cell weight and L-threonine production, the fermentation process was optimized. When biotin was added as growth factor, L-threonine production reached 52.0 g/l from 15.9 g/l without biotin. Dry cell weight and L-threonine production were further increased by continuous feeding of the feed media with an optimized L-methionine concentration (5.0 g/l). However, high-cell-density culture caused oxygen-limited condition, which resulted in the accumulation of organic acids. To overcome this problem, oxygen-enriched air was supplied to the fermentor with the minimal salt medium. Under these optimal conditions, we achieved an L-threonine production of 80.2 g/l in the minimal salt medium."
"Metabolic Engineering of Escherichia coli for De Novo Production of 1,5-Pentanediol from Glucose","Cen, X., et al.",ACS Synth Biol,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00567,"1,5-Pentanediol (1,5-PDO) is an important C5 building block for the synthesis of different value-added polyurethanes and polyesters. However, no natural metabolic pathway exists for the biosynthesis of 1,5-PDO. Herein we designed and constructed a promising nonnatural pathway for de novo production of 1,5-PDO from cheap carbohydrates. This biosynthesis route expands natural lysine pathways and employs two artificial metabolic modules to sequentially convert lysine into 5-hydroxyvalerate (5-HV) and 1,5-PDO via 5-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA. Theoretically, the 5-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA-based pathway is more energy-efficient than a recently published carboxylic acid reductase-based pathway for 1,5-PDO production. By combining strategies of systematic enzyme screening, pathway balancing, and transporter engineering, we successfully constructed a minimally engineered Escherichia coli strain capable of producing 3.19 g/L of 5-HV and 0.35 g/L of 1,5-PDO in a medium containing 20 g/L of glucose and 5 g/L lysine. Introducing the synthetic modules into a lysine producer and enhancing NADPH supply enabled the strain to accumulate 1.04 g/L of 5-HV and 0.12 g/L of 1,5-PDO using glucose as the main carbon source. This work lays the basis for the development of a biological route for 1,5-PDO production from renewable bioresources."
Systems engineering of Escherichia coli for high-level shikimate production,"Li, Z., et al.",Metab Eng,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2022.10.010,"To further increase the production efficiency of microbial shikimate, a valuable compound widely used in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, ten key target genes contributing to shikimate production were identified by exploiting the enzyme constraint model ec_iML1515, and subsequently used for promoting metabolic flux towards shikimate biosynthesis in the tryptophan-overproducing strain Escherichia coli TRP0. The engineered E. coli SA05 produced 78.4 g/L shikimate via fed-batch fermentation. Deletion of quinate dehydrogenase and introduction of the hydroaromatic equilibration-alleviating shikimate dehydrogenase mutant AroE(T61W/L241I) reduced the contents of byproducts quinate (7.5 g/L) and 3-dehydroshikimic acid (21.4 g/L) by 89.1% and 52.1%, respectively. Furthermore, a high concentration shikimate responsive promoter P(rpoS) was recruited to dynamically regulate the expression of the tolerance target ProV to enhance shikimate productivity by 23.2% (to 2 g/L/h). Finally, the shikimate titer was increased to 126.4 g/L, with a yield of 0.50 g/g glucose and productivity of 2.63 g/L/h, using a 30-L fermenter and the engineered strain E. coli SA09. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported shikimate titer and productivity in E. coli."
Optimization of bioethanol production from glycerol by Escherichia coli SS1,"NAA Adnan, S Abd-Aziz, MA Hassan",Renewable energy,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.12.032,"Bioethanol is a promising biofuel and has a lot of great prospective and could become an alternative to fossil fuels. Ethanol fermentation using glycerol as carbon source was carried out by local isolate, ethanologenic bacterium Escherichia coli SS1 in a close system. Factors affecting bioethanol production from pure glycerol were optimized via response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). Four significant variables were found to influence bioethanol yield; initial pH of fermentation medium, substrate concentration, salt content and organic nitrogen concentration with statistically significant effect (p â¤ 0.05) on bioethanol production. The significant factor was then analyzed using central composite design (CCD). The optimum conditions for bioethanol production were substrate concentration at 34.5 g/L, pH 7.61, and organic nitrogen concentration at 6.42 g/L in which giving ethanol yield approximately 1.00 mol/mol. In addition, batch ethanol fermentation in a 2 L bioreactor was performed at the glycerol concentration of 20 g/L, 35 g/L and 45 g/L, respectively. The ethanol yields obtained from all tested glycerol concentrations were approaching theoretical yield when the batch fermentation was performed at optimized conditions."
An evolutionary strategy for isobutanol production strain development in Escherichia coli,"Smith, K. M. and J. C. Liao",Metab Eng,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2011.08.004,"Higher alcohols such as isobutanol possess several physical characteristics that make them attractive as biofuels such as higher energy densities and infrastructure compatibility. Here we have developed a rapid evolutionary strategy for isolating strains of Escherichia coli that effectively produce isobutanol from glucose utilizing random mutagenesis and a growth selection scheme. By selecting for mutants with the ability to grow in the presence of the valine analog norvaline, we obtained E. coli NV3 a strain with improved 24-h isobutanol production (8.0 g/L) in comparison with a productivity of 5.3g/L isobutanol obtained with the parental wild type strain. Genomic sequencing of NV3 identified the insertion of a stop codon in the C-terminus of the RNA polymerase sigma(s)-factor, RpoS. Upon repair of this inhibitory mutation (strain NV3r1), a final isobutanol titer of 21.2g/L isobutanol was achieved in 99 h with a yield of 0.31 g isobutanol/g glucose or 76% of theoretical maximum. Furthermore, a mutation in ldhA, encoding d-lactate dehydrogenase, was identified in NV3 however, repair of LdhA in NV3r1 had no affect on LdhA activity detected from cell extracts or on isobutanol productivity. Further study of NV3r1 may identify novel genotypes that confer improved isobutanol production."
Optimization of Fermentation Conditions for the Biosynthesis of l-Threonine by Escherichia coli,"N Chen, J Huang, Z Feng, L Yu, Q Xuâ¦",Applied biochemistry and Biotechnology,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-008-8385-y,"In this study, the fed-batch fermentation technique was applied to improve the yield of L-threonine produced by Escherichia coli TRFC. Various fermentation substrates and conditions were investigated to identify the optimal carbon source, its concentration and C/N ratio in the production of L-threonine. Sucrose was found to be the optimal initial carbon source and its optimal concentration was determined to be 70 g/L based on the results of fermentations conducted in a 5-L jar fermentor using a series of fed-batch cultures of E. coli TRFC. The effects of glucose concentration and three different feeding methods on the production of L-threonine were also investigated in this work. Our results showed that the production of L-threonine by E. coli was enhanced when glucose concentration varied between 5 and 20 g/L with DO-control pulse fed-batch method. Furthermore, the C/N ratio was a more predominant factor than nitrogen concentration for L-threonine overproduction and the optimal ratio of ammonium sulfate to sucrose (g/g) was 30. Under the optimal conditions, a final L-threonine concentration of 118 g/L was achieved after 38 h with the productivity of 3.1 g/L/h (46% conversion ratio from glucose to threonine)."
Isobutyraldehyde production from Escherichia coli by removing aldehyde reductase activity,"Rodriguez, G. M. and S. Atsumi",Microb Cell Fact,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-11-90,"BACKGROUND: Increasing global demand and reliance on petroleum-derived chemicals will necessitate alternative sources for chemical feedstocks. Currently, 99% of chemical feedstocks are derived from petroleum and natural gas. Renewable methods for producing important chemical feedstocks largely remain unaddressed. Synthetic biology enables the renewable production of various chemicals from microorganisms by constructing unique metabolic pathways. Here, we engineer Escherichia coli for the production of isobutyraldehyde, which can be readily converted to various hydrocarbons currently derived from petroleum such as isobutyric acid, acetal, oxime and imine using existing chemical catalysis. Isobutyraldehyde can be readily stripped from cultures during production, which reduces toxic effects of isobutyraldehyde. RESULTS: We adopted the isobutanol pathway previously constructed in E. coli, neglecting the last step in the pathway where isobutyraldehyde is converted to isobutanol. However, this strain still overwhelmingly produced isobutanol (1.5 g/L/OD(600) (isobutanol) vs 0.14 g/L/OD(600) (isobutyraldehyde)). Next, we deleted yqhD which encodes a broad-substrate range aldehyde reductase known to be active toward isobutyraldehyde. This strain produced isobutanol and isobutyraldehyde at a near 1:1 ratio, indicating further native isobutyraldehyde reductase (IBR) activity in E. coli. To further eliminate isobutanol formation, we set out to identify and remove the remaining IBRs from the E. coli genome. We identified 7 annotated genes coding for IBRs that could be active toward isobutyraldehyde: adhP, eutG, yiaY, yjgB, betA, fucO, eutE. Individual deletions of the genes yielded only marginal improvements. Therefore, we sequentially deleted all seven of the genes and assessed production. The combined deletions greatly increased isobutyraldehyde production (1.5 g/L/OD(600)) and decreased isobutanol production (0.4 g/L/OD(600)). By assessing production by overexpression of each candidate IBR, we reveal that AdhP, EutG, YjgB, and FucO are active toward isobutyraldehyde. Finally, we assessed long-term isobutyraldehyde production of our best strain containing a total of 15 gene deletions using a gas stripping system with in situ product removal, resulting in a final titer of 35 g/L after 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we optimized E. coli for the production of the important chemical feedstock isobutyraldehyde by the removal of IBRs. Long-term production yielded industrially relevant titers of isobutyraldehyde with in situ product removal. The mutational load imparted on E. coli in this work demonstrates the versatility of metabolic engineering for strain improvements."
Improving lysine production through construction of an Escherichia coli enzymeâconstrained model,"C Ye, L Guo, C Gao",Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27485,"Microbial cell factories are widely used for the production of high-value chemicals. However, maximizing production titers is made difficult by the complicated regulatory mechanisms of these cell platforms. Here, kcat values were incorporated to construct an Escherichia coli enzyme-constrained model. The resulting ec_iML1515 model showed that the protein demand and protein synthesis rate were the key factors affecting lysine production. By optimizing the expression of the 20 top-demanded proteins, lysine titers reached 95.7â±â0.7âg/L, with a 0.45âg/g glucose yield. Moreover, adjusting NH4+ and dissolved oxygen levels to regulate the synthesis rate of energy metabolism-related proteins caused lysine titers and glucose yields to increase to 193.6â±â1.8âg/L and 0.74âg/g, respectively. The ec_iML1515 model provides insight into how enzymes required for the biosynthesis of certain products are distributed between and within metabolic pathways. This information can be used to accurately predict and rationally design lysine production."
An artificial pathway for trans-4-hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid production from L-lysine in Escherichia coli,"Cheng, J., et al.",Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/bbb/zbac118,"Trans-4-hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid (trans-4-HyPip) is a hydroxylated product of L-pipecolic acid, which is widely used in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Here, a trans-4-HyPip biosynthesis module was designed and constructed in Escherichia coli by overexpressing lysine alpha-oxidase, Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylase reductase, glucose dehydrogenase, lysine permease, catalase and L-pipecolic acid trans-4-hydroxylase for expanding the lysine catabolism pathway. A total of 4.89 g/L of trans-4-HyPip was generated in shake flasks from 8 g/L of L-pipecolic acid. By this approach, 14.86 g/L of trans-4-HyPip was produced from lysine after 48 h in a 5 L bioreactor. As far as we know, this is the first multi-enzyme cascade catalytic system for the production of trans-4-HyPip using E. coli from L-lysine. Therefore, it can be considered as a potential candidate for the industrial production of trans-4-HyPip in microorganisms."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for high-yield uridine production,"Wu, H., et al.",Metab Eng,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.09.001,"Uridine is a kind of pyrimidine nucleoside that has been widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry. Although microbial fermentation is a promising method for industrial production of uridine, an efficient microbial cell factory is still lacking. In this study, we constructed a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli capable of high-yield uridine production. First, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated chromosomal integration strategy to integrate large DNA into the E. coli chromosome, and a 9.7â¯kb DNA fragment including eight genes in the pyrimidine operon of Bacillus subtilis F126 was integrated into the yghX locus of E. coli W3110. The resultant strain produced 3.3â¯g/L uridine and 4.5â¯g/L uracil in shake flask culture for 32â¯h. Subsequently, five genes involved in uridine catabolism were knocked out, and the uridine titer increased to 7.8â¯g/L. As carbamyl phosphate, aspartate, and 5'-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate are important precursors for uridine synthesis, we further modified several metabolism-related genes and synergistically improved the supply of these precursors, leading to a 76.9% increase in uridine production. Finally, nupC and nupG encoding nucleoside transport proteins were deleted, and the extracellular uridine accumulation increased to 14.5â¯g/L. After 64â¯h of fed-batch fermentation, the final engineered strain UR6 produced 70.3â¯g/L uridine with a yield and productivity of 0.259â¯g/g glucose and 1.1â¯g/L/h, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest uridine titer and productivity ever reported for the fermentative production of uridine."

Here, we report the development of the genetically defined lâthreonine overproducing Escherichia coli strain by systems metabolic engineering. Feedback inhibitions of aspartokinase I and III (encoded by thrA and lysC, respectively) and transcriptional attenuation regulations (located in thrL) were removed. Pathways for Thr degradation were removed by deleting tdh and mutating ilvA. The metA and lysA genes were deleted to make more precursors available for Thr biosynthesis.

The expression system was improved by reducing of the amount of expensive L-rhamnose necessary for induction of the rhamnose promoter and by increasing the vector stability. Consumption of the inducer L-rhamnose was inhibited by inactivation of L-rhamnulose kinase encoding gene rhaB of Escherichia coli W3110, responsible for the first irreversible step in rhamnose catabolism.

Production of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Zeng, W., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124069,"The 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG) is the direct precursor for industrial vitamin C production. The main biosynthetic method for 2-KLG production is the classical two-step fermentation route. However, disadvantages of this method are emerging, including high consumption of energy, difficulties in strain screening, complex operation, and poor stability. In this study, five recombinant Escherichia coli strains overexpressing different sorbose/sorbosone dehydrogenases were constructed and used for 2-KLG production. By optimizing catalytic conditions and further expressing pyrroloquinoline quinone in the recombinant strain, the titer of 2-KLG reached 72.4 g/L, with a conversion ratio from L-sorbose of 71.2% in a 5-L bioreactor. To achieve direct biosynthesis of 2-KLG from D-sorbitol, a co-culture system consisting of Gluconobacter oxydans and recombinant E. coli was designed. With this co-culture system, 16.8 g/L of 2-KLG was harvested, with a conversion ratio from D-sorbitol of 33.6%.

Understanding and Improving NADPHâDependent Reactions by Nongrowing Escherichia coli Cells,"AZ Walton, JD Stewart",Biotechnology progress,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/bp030044m,"We have shown that whole Escherichia coli cells overexpressing NADPH-dependent cyclohexanone monooxygenase carry out a model Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with high volumetric productivity (0.79 g Ïµ-caprolactone/L·h ) under nongrowing conditions (Walton, A. Z.; Stewart, J. D. Biotechnol. Prog. 2002, 18, 262â268). This is approximately 20-fold higher than the space-time yield for reactions that used growing cells of the same strain. Here, we show that the intracellular stability of cyclohexanone monooxygenase and the rate of substrate transport across the cell membrane were the key limitations on the overall reaction duration and rate, respectively. Directly measuring the levels of intracellular nicotinamide cofactors under bioprocess conditions suggested that E. coli cells could support even more efficient NADPH-dependent bioconversions if a more suitable enzyme-substrate pair were identified. This was demonstrated by reducing ethyl acetoacetate with whole cells of an E. coli strain that overexpressed an NADPH-dependent, short-chain dehydrogenase from bakerapos;s yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Under glucose-fed, nongrowing conditions, this reduction proceeded with a space-time yield of 2.0 g/L·h and a final product titer of 15.8 g/L using a biocatalyst:substrate ratio (g/g) of only 0.37. These values are significantly higher than those obtained previously. Moreover, the stoichiometry linking ketone reduction and glucose consumption (2.3 ± 0.1) suggested that the citric acid cycle supplied the bulk of the intracellular NADPH under our process conditions. This information can be used to improve the efficiency of glucose utilization even further by metabolic engineering strategies that increase carbon flux through the pentose phosphate pathway."
Expression regulation of multiple key genes to improve L-threonine in Escherichia coli,"Zhao, L., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-020-01312-5,"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is an important strain for L-threonine production. Genetic switch is a ubiquitous regulatory tool for gene expression in prokaryotic cells. To sense and regulate intracellular or extracellular chemicals, bacteria evolve a variety of transcription factors. The key enzymes required for L-threonine biosynthesis in E. coli are encoded by the thr operon. The thr operon could coordinate expression of these genes when L-threonine is in short supply in the cell. RESULTS: The thrL leader regulatory elements were applied to regulate the expression of genes iclR, arcA, cpxR, gadE, fadR and pykF, while the threonine-activating promoters P(cysH), P(cysJ) and P(cysD) were applied to regulate the expression of gene aspC, resulting in the increase of L-threonine production in an L-threonine producing E. coli strain TWF001. Firstly, different parts of the regulator thrL were inserted in the iclR regulator region in TWF001, and the best resulting strain TWF063 produced 16.34 g L-threonine from 40 g glucose after 30 h cultivation. Secondly, the gene aspC following different threonine-activating promoters was inserted into the chromosome of TWF063, and the best resulting strain TWF066 produced 17.56 g L-threonine from 40 g glucose after 30 h cultivation. Thirdly, the effect of expression regulation of arcA, cpxR, gadE, pykF and fadR was individually investigated on L-threonine production in TWF001. Finally, using TWF066 as the starting strain, the expression of genes arcA, cpxR, gadE, pykF and fadR was regulated individually or in combination to obtain the best strain for L-threonine production. The resulting strain TWF083, in which the expression of seven genes (iclR, aspC, arcA, cpxR, gadE, pykF, fadR and aspC) was regulated, produced 18.76 g L-threonine from 30 g glucose, 26.50 g L-threonine from 40 g glucose, or 26.93 g L-threonine from 50 g glucose after 30 h cultivation. In 48 h fed-batch fermentation, TWF083 could produce 116.62 g/L L-threonine with a yield of 0.486 g/g glucose and productivity of 2.43 g/L/h. CONCLUSION: The genetic engineering through the expression regulation of key genes is a better strategy than simple deletion of these genes to improve L-threonine production in E. coli. This strategy has little effect on the intracellular metabolism in the early stage of the growth but could increase L-threonine biosynthesis in the late stage."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for d-pantothenic acid production,"Zhang, B., et al.",Food Chem,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.05.044,"Escherichia coli was engineered to produce d-pantothenic acid via systematic metabolic engineering. Firstly, genes of acetohydroxy acid synthase II, pantothenate synthetase, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase, 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase and ketol-acid reductoisomerase were edited in E. coli W3110 with a resulting d-pantothenic acid yield of 0.49â¯g/L. Expressions of valine-pyruvate aminotransferase and branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase were then attenuated to decrease the carbon flux in l-valine biosynthetic pathway which is a competing pathway to the d-pantothenic acid biosynthetic pathway, and the yield increased to 1.48â¯g/L. Mutagenesis of pantothenate kinase and deletion of threonine deaminase further increased the production to 1.78â¯g/L. Overexpressions of panC and panB from Corynebacterium glutamicum enhanced the production by 29%. In fed-batch fermentations, strain DPA-9/pTrc99a-panBC(C.G) exhibited a highest d-pantothenic acid yield of 28.45â¯g/L. The findings in this study demonstrate the systematic metabolic engineering in Escherichia coli W3110 would be a promising strategy for industrial production of d-pantothenic acid."
Enhanced biosynthesis of Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in Escherichia coli by pathway engineering,"P Yu, Q Ren, X Wang, X Huang",Biochemical Engineering Journal,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2018.10.025,"The compound Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is widely used in various fields. The combinatory strategy of the gene knockout and overexpression in a wild-type Escherichia coli K12 to improve the production of GABA was investigated. In E. coli, gabP encodes GABA permease responsible for absorbing extracellular GABA from medium. gabT and puuE encode GABA transaminases that can catalyze the reversible interconversion between GABA and succinic semialdehyde (SSA). These three genes were firstly deleted in E. coli K12 using Î»Red/ET system. Another three genes related to the biosynthesis and transportation of GABA, gadA, gadB and gadC, were overexpressed.

Effect of Different Carbon Sources on the Production of Succinic Acid Using Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli,D Hodge,Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/bp060301y,"Succinic acid (SA) is an important platform molecule in the synthesis of a number of commodity and specialty chemicals. In the present work, dual-phase batch fermentations with the E. coli strain AFP184 were performed using a medium suited for large-scale industrial production of SA. The ability of the strain to ferment different sugars was investigated. The sugars studied were sucrose, glucose, fructose, xylose, and equal mixtures of glucose and fructose and glucose and xylose at a total initial sugar concentration of 100 g Lâ1. AFP184 was able to utilize all sugars and sugar combinations except sucrose for biomass generation and succinate production. For sucrose as a substrate no succinic acid was produced and none of the sucrose was metabolized. The succinic acid yield from glucose (0.83 g succinic acid per gram glucose consumed anaerobically) was higher than the yield from fructose (0.66 g gâ1). When using xylose as a carbon source, a yield of 0.50 g gâ1 was obtained. In the mixed-sugar fermentations no catabolite repression was detected. Mixtures of glucose and xylose resulted in higher yields (0.60 g gâ1) than use of xylose alone. Fermenting glucose mixed with fructose gave a lower yield (0.58 g gâ1) than fructose used as the sole carbon source. The reason is an increased pyruvate production. The pyruvate concentration decreased later in the fermentation. Final succinic acid concentrations were in the range of 25â40 g Lâ1. Acetic and pyruvic acid were the only other products detected and accumulated to concentrations of 2.7â6.7 and 0â2.7 g Lâ1. Production of succinic acid decreased when organic acid concentrations reached approximately 30 g Lâ1. This study demonstrates that E. coli strain AFP184 is able to produce succinic acid in a low cost medium from a variety of sugars with only small amounts of byproducts formed."

Then, the imbalanced enzyme expression levels of L-lysine decarboxylase from Escherichia coli (EcCA), putrescine aminotransferase (KpcPA) and Î³-aminovaleraldehyde dehydrogenase (KpcPD) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the poor catalytic efficiency of KpcPA were identified as the rate-limiting bottlenecks. To this end, ribosome binding site regulation was employed to coordinate the enzyme molar ratio of EcCA:KpcPA:KpcPD at approximately 4:8:7 (the optimum ratio obtained in vitro), and volume scanning and hydrophobicity scanning were applied to increase KpcPA activity toward cadaverine from 15.89 ± 0.52 to 75.87 ± 1.51 U·mgâ1. Furthermore, the extracellular accumulation of 5-aminovalerate (5AVA) was considerably reduced by overexpressing gabP encoding the 5AVA importer.

Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates using acetate as a main carbon source,"Chen, J., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-018-0949-0,"BACKGROUND: High production cost of bioplastics polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is a major obstacle to replace traditional petro-based plastics. To address the challenges, strategies towards upstream metabolic engineering and downstream fermentation optimizations have been continuously pursued. Given that the feedstocks especially carbon sources account up to a large portion of the production cost, it is of great importance to explore low cost substrates to manufacture PHA economically. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to synthesize poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB4HB), and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) using acetate as a main carbon source. Overexpression of phosphotransacetylase/acetate kinase pathway was shown to be an effective strategy for improving acetate assimilation and biopolymer production. The recombinant strain overexpressing phosphotransacetylase/acetate kinase and P3HB synthesis operon produced 1.27 g/L P3HB when grown on minimal medium supplemented with 10 g/L yeast extract and 5 g/L acetate in shake flask cultures. Further introduction succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and CoA transferase lead to the accumulation of P3HB4HB, reaching a titer of 1.71 g/L with a 4-hydroxybutyrate monomer content of 5.79 mol%. When 1 g/L of alpha-ketoglutarate or citrate was added to the medium, P3HB4HB titer increased to 1.99 and 2.15 g/L, respectively. To achieve PHBV synthesis, acetate and propionate were simultaneously supplied and propionyl-CoA transferase was overexpressed to provide 3-hydroxyvalerate precursor. The resulting strain produced 0.33 g/L PHBV with a 3-hydroxyvalerate monomer content of 6.58 mol%. Further overexpression of propionate permease improved PHBV titer and 3-hydroxyvalerate monomer content to 1.09 g/L and 10.37 mol%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The application of acetate as carbon source for microbial fermentation could reduce the consumption of food and agro-based renewable bioresources for biorefineries. Our proposed metabolic engineering strategies illustrate the feasibility for producing polyhydroxyalkanoates using acetate as a main carbon source. Overall, as an abundant and renewable resource, acetate would be developed into a cost-effective feedstock to achieve low cost production of chemicals, materials, and biofuels."
Pathway optimization by re-design of untranslated regions for L-tyrosine production in Escherichia coli,"Kim, S. C., et al.",Sci Rep,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep13853,"L-tyrosine is a commercially important compound in the food, pharmaceutical, chemical, and cosmetic industries. Although several attempts have been made to improve L-tyrosine production, translation-level expression control and carbon flux rebalancing around phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) node still remain to be achieved for optimizing the pathway. Here, we demonstrate pathway optimization by altering gene expression levels for L-tyrosine production in Escherichia coli. To optimize the L-tyrosine biosynthetic pathway, a synthetic constitutive promoter and a synthetic 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) were introduced for each gene of interest to allow for control at both transcription and translation levels. Carbon flux rebalancing was achieved by controlling the expression level of PEP synthetase using UTR Designer. The L-tyrosine productivity of the engineered E. coli strain was increased through pathway optimization resulting in 3.0 g/L of L-tyrosine titer, 0.0354 g L-tyrosine/h/g DCW of productivity, and 0.102 g L-tyrosine/g glucose yield. Thus, this work demonstrates that pathway optimization by 5'-UTR redesign is an effective strategy for the development of efficient L-tyrosine-producing bacteria."

Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for high-specificity production of isoprenol and prenol as next generation of biofuels,"Zheng, Y., et al.",Biotechnol Biofuels,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-6-57,"BACKGROUND: The isopentenols, including isoprenol and prenol, are excellent alternative fuels. However, they are not compounds largely accumulated in natural organism. The need for the next generation of biofuels with better physical and chemical properties impels us to develop biosynthetic routes for the production of isoprenol and prenol from renewable sugar. In this study, we use the heterogenous mevalonate-dependent (MVA) isoprenoid pathway for the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) intermediates, and then convert IPP and DMAPP to isoprenol and prenol, respectively. RESULTS: A mevalonate titer of 1.7 g/L was obtained by constructing an efficient MVA upper pathway in engineered E. coli. Different phosphatases and pyrophosphatases were investigated for their abilities in hydrolyzing the IPP and DMAPP. Consequently, ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase was found to be an efficient IPP and DMAPP hydrolase. Moreover, ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase from Bacillus subtilis (BsNudF) exhibited a equivalent substrate specificity towards IPP and DMAPP, while ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase from E. coli (EcNudF) presented a high substrate preference for DMAPP. Without the expression of any phosphatases or pyrophosphatases, a background level of isopentenols was synthesized. When the endogenous pyrophosphatase genes (EcNudF and yggV) that were capable of enhancing the hydrolyzation of the IPP and DMAPP were knocked out, the background level of isopentenols was still obtained. Maybe the synthesized IPP and DMAPP were hydrolyzed by some unknown hydrolases of E. coli. Finally, 1.3 g/L single isoprenol was obtained by blocking the conversion of IPP to DMAPP and employing the BsNudF, and 0.2 g/L ~80% prenol was produced by employing the EcNudF. A maximal yield of 12% was achieved in both isoprenol and prenol producing strains. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful report on high-specificity production of isoprenol and prenol by microbial fermentation. Over 1.3 g/L isoprenol achieved in shake-flask experiments represents a quite encouraging titer of higher alcohols. In addition, the substrate specificities of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases were determined and successfully applied for the high-specificity synthesis of isoprenol and prenol. Altogether, this work presents a promising strategy for high-specificity production of two excellent biofuels, isoprenol and prenol."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for production of 2âPhenylethylacetate from Lâphenylalanine,"D Guo, L Zhang, H Pan, X Li",Microbiologyopen,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.486,"In order to meet the need of consumer preferences for natural flavor compounds, microbial synthesis method has become a very attractive alternative to the chemical production. The 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) and its ester 2-phenylethylacetate (2-PEAc) are two extremely important flavor compounds with a rose-like odor. In recent years, Escherichia coli and yeast have been metabolically engineered to produce 2-PE. However, a metabolic engineering approach for 2-PEAc production is rare. Here, we designed and expressed a 2-PEAc biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. This pathway comprised four steps: aminotransferase (ARO8) for transamination of L-phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate, 2-keto acid decarboxylase KDC for the decarboxylation of the phenylpyruvate to phenylacetaldehyde, aldehyde reductase YjgB for the reduction of phenylacetaldehyde to 2-PE, alcohol acetyltransferase ATF1 for the esterification of 2-PE to 2-PEAc. Using the engineered E. coli strain for shake flasks cultivation with 1 g/L L-phenylalanine, we achieved co-production of 268 mg/L 2-PEAc and 277 mg/L 2-PE. Our results suggest that approximately 65% of L-phenylalanine was utilized toward 2-PEAc and 2-PE biosynthesis and thus demonstrate potential industrial applicability of this microbial platform."
Modification of glycolysis and its effect on the production of l-threonine in Escherichia coli,"X Xie, Y Liang, H Liu, Y Liu, Q Xuâ¦",Journal of industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-014-1436-1,"High concentrations of acetate, the main by-product of Escherichia coli (E. coli) high cell density culture, inhibit bacterial growth and L-threonine production. Since metabolic overflux causes acetate accumulation, we attempted to reduce acetate production by redirecting glycolysis flux to the pentose phosphate pathway by deleting the genes encoding phosphofructokinase (pfk) and/or pyruvate kinase (pyk) in an L-threonine-producing strain of E. coli, THRD. pykF, pykA, pfkA, and pfkB deletion mutants produced less acetate (9.44 ± 0.83, 3.86 ± 0.88, 0.30 ± 0.25, and 6.99 ± 0.85 g/l, respectively) than wild-type THRD cultures (19.75 ± 0.93 g/l). THRDÎpykF and THRDÎpykA produced 11.05 and 5.35 % more L-threonine, and achieved a 10.91 and 5.60 % higher yield on glucose, respectively. While THRDÎpfkA grew more slowly and produced less L-threonine than THRD, THRDÎpfkB produced levels of L-threonine (102.28 ± 2.80 g/l) and a yield on glucose (0.34 g/g) similar to that of THRD. The dual deletion mutant THRDÎpfkBÎpykF also achieved low acetate (7.42 ± 0.81 g/l) and high L-threonine yields (111.37 ± 2.71 g/l). The level of NADPH in THRDÎpfkA cultures was depressed, whereas all other mutants produced more NADPH than THRD did. These results demonstrated that modification of glycolysis in E. coli THRD reduced acetate production and increased accumulation of L-threonine."
Production of Rainbow Colorants by Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli,"Yang, D., et al.",Adv Sci (Weinh),2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100743,"There has been much interest in producing natural colorants to replace synthetic colorants of health concerns. Escherichia coli has been employed to produce natural colorants including carotenoids, indigo, anthocyanins, and violacein. However, production of natural green and navy colorants has not been reported. Many natural products are hydrophobic, which are accumulated inside or on the cell membrane. This causes cell growth limitation and consequently reduces production of target chemicals. Here, integrated membrane engineering strategies are reported for the enhanced production of rainbow colorants-three carotenoids and four violacein derivatives-as representative hydrophobic natural products in E. coli. By integration of systems metabolic engineering, cell morphology engineering, inner- and outer-membrane vesicle formation, and fermentation optimization, production of rainbow colorants are significantly enhanced to 322 mg L(-1) of astaxanthin (red), 343 mg L(-1) of beta-carotene (orange), 218 mg L(-1) of zeaxanthin (yellow), 1.42 g L(-1) of proviolacein (green), 0.844 g L(-1) of prodeoxyviolacein (blue), 6.19 g L(-1) of violacein (navy), and 11.26 g L(-1) of deoxyviolacein (purple). The membrane engineering strategies reported here are generally applicable to microbial production of a broader range of hydrophobic natural products, contributing to food, cosmetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries."
Enhancing tryptophan production by balancing precursors in Escherichia coli,"Guo, L., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.28019,"Tryptophan, an essential aromatic amino acid, is widely used in animal feed, food additives, and pharmaceuticals. Although sustainable and environmentally friendly, microbial tryptophan production from renewable feedstocks is limited by low biosynthesis and transport rates. Here, an Escherichia coli strain capable of efficient tryptophan production was generated by improving and balancing the supply of precursors and by engineering membrane transporters. Tryptophan biosynthesis was increased by eliminating negative regulatory factors, blocking competing pathways, and preventing tryptophan degradation. Promoter engineering balanced the supply of the precursors erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, as well as the availability of serine. Finally, the engineering of tryptophan transporters prevented feedback inhibition and growth toxicity. Fed-batch fermentation of the final strain (TRP12) in a 5 L bioreactor produced 52.1 g.L(-1) of tryptophan, with a yield of 0.171 g.g(-1) glucose and productivity of 1.45 g.L(-1) .h(-1) . The metabolic engineering strategy described here paves the way for high-performance microbial cell factories aimed at the production of tryptophan as well as other valuable chemicals."
Production of Succinic Acid from Amino Acids in Escherichia coli,"Chiang, C. J., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02958,"Glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) are the most abundant amino acids in various sources of protein waste, recognized as a sustainable resource. In this study, Escherichia coli was engineered to produce succinic acid (SA) from Glu and Asp. Succinate dehydrogenase involved in the tricarboxylic acid was inactivated in the Glu-utilizing strain. To grow on Asp, this mutant strain was subjected to metabolic evolution. One resulting strain capable of metabolizing Asp was further evolved to improve the growth of Glu and Asp. After the deletion of arcA, the resulting strain was employed for the aerobic production of SA. The shake-flask culture was conducted with the minimal medium containing 10 g/L Glu and 10 g/L Asp. Finally, it resulted in the SA production, with a titer, the molar yield, and productivity reaching 72.8 mM (i.e., 8.6 g/L), 0.54 (ca. 75.4% of the theoretical yield), and 0.66 g/L/h, respectively.

Enhanced L-methionine production by genetically engineered Escherichia coli through fermentation optimization,"Zhou, H. Y., et al.",3 Biotech,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1609-8,"Microbial fermentation for L-methionine (L-Met) production based on natural renewable resources is attractive and challenging. In this work, the effects of medium composition and fermentation conditions were investigated to improve L-Met production by genetically engineered Escherichia coli MET-3. Statistical optimization techniques including Plackett-Burman (PB) design and Box-Behnken design (BBD) were adopted first to optimize the culture medium. Results of PB-designed experiments indicated that the culture medium components including glucose, yeast extract, KH(2)PO(4), and MgSO(4).7H(2)O had significant effects on L-Met biosynthesis. With their best-predicted concentration established by BBD (glucose 37.43 g/L, yeast extract 0.95 g/L, KH(2)PO(4) 1.82 g/L, and MgSO(4).7H(2)O 4.51 g/L), L-Met titer was increased to 3.04 g/L from less than 2.0 g/L. For further enhancement of L-Met biosynthesis, the fermentation conditions of batch cultivation carried out in a 5-L fermentor were optimized, and the optimum results were obtained at an agitation rate of 300 rpm, medium pH of 7.0, and induction temperature of 28 degrees C. Based on the optimization parameters, fed-batch fermentation with the modified medium was conducted. As a result, great improvement of L-Met titer (12.80 g/L) and yield (0.13 mol/mol) were achieved, with an increase of 38.53% and 30.0% compared with those of the basal medium, respectively. Furthermore, higher L-Met productivity of 0.261 g/L/h was obtained, representing 2.13-fold higher in comparison to the original medium. The results may provide a helpful reference for further study on strain improvement and fermentation control."

In order to reduce acetate production several strategies were attempted, among which increasing the flux of the anaplerotic pathways through overexpression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene ppc or the glyoxylate shunt operon aceBA effectively reduced acetate and improved fumaric acid production. In fed-batch culture, the resulting strain EF02(pSCppc) produced 41.5 g/L fumaric acid from glycerol with 70% of the maximum theoretical yield and an overall productivity of 0.51 g/L/h."

Ethanol production from corn cob hydrolysates by Escherichia coli KO11,"de Carvalho Lima, K. G., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.7000287,"Corn cob hydrolysates, with xylose as the dominant sugar, were fermented to ethanol by recombinant Escherichia coli KO11. When inoculum was grown on LB medium containing glucose, fermentation of the hydrolysate was completed in 163 h and ethanol yield was 0.50 g ethanol/g sugar. When inoculum was grown on xylose, ethanol yield dropped, but fermentation was faster (113 h). Hydrolysate containing 72.0 g/l xylose and supplemented with 20.0 g/l rice bran was readily fermented, producing 36.0 g/l ethanol within 70 h. Maximum ethanol concentrations were not higher for fermentations using higher cellular concentration inocula. A simulation of an industrial process integrating pentose fermentation by E. coli and hexose fermentation by yeast was carried out. At the first step, E. coli fermented the hydrolysate containing 85.0 g/l xylose, producing 40.0 g/l ethanol in 94 h. Baker's yeast and sucrose (150.0 g/l) were then added to the spent fermentation broth. After 8 h of yeast fermentation, the ethanol concentration reached 104.0 g/l. This two-stage fermentation can render the bioconversion of lignocellulose to ethanol more attractive due to increased final alcohol concentration."
Improving L-threonine production in Escherichia coli by elimination of transporters ProP and ProVWX,"Wang, S., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-021-01546-x,"BACKGROUND: Betaine, an osmoprotective compatible solute, has been used to improve L-threonine production in engineered Escherichia coli L-threonine producer. Betaine supplementation upregulates the expression of zwf encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to the increase of NADPH, which is beneficial for L-threonine production. In E. coli, betaine can be taken through ProP encoded by proP or ProVWX encoded by proVWX. ProP is a H(+)-osmolyte symporter, whereas ProVWX is an ABC transporter. ProP and ProVWX mediate osmotic stress protection by transporting zwitterionic osmolytes, including glycine betaine. Betaine can also be synthesized in E. coli by enzymes encoded by betABIT. However, the influence of ProP, ProVWX and betABIT on L-threonine production in E. coli has not been investigated. RESULTS: In this study, the influence of ProP, ProVWX and betABIT on L-threonine production in E. coli has been investigated. Addition of betaine slightly improved the growth of the L-threonine producing E. coli strain TWF001 as well as the L-threonine production. Deletion of betABIT retarded the growth of TWF001 and slightly decreased the L-threonine production. However, deletion of proP or/and proVWX significantly increased the L-threonine production. When proP was deleted, the L-threonine production increased 33.3% when proVWX was deleted, the L-threonine production increased 40.0%. When both proP and proVWX were deleted, the resulting strain TSW003 produced 23.5 g/l L-threonine after 36 h flask cultivation. The genes betABIT, proC, fadR, crr and ptsG were individually deleted from TSW003, and it was found that further absence of either crr (TWS008) or ptsG (TWS009) improved L-threonine production. TSW008 produced 24.9 g/l L-threonine after 36 h flask cultivation with a yield of 0.62 g/g glucose and a productivity of 0.69 g/l/h. TSW009 produced 26 g/l L-threonine after 48 h flask cultivation with a yield of 0.65 g/g glucose and a productivity of 0.54 g/l/h, which is 116% increase compared to the control TWF001. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, L-threonine-producing E. coli strains TSW008 and TSW009 with high L-threonine productivity were developed by regulating the intracellular osmotic pressure. This strategy could be used to improve the production of other products in microorganisms."
Fermentation of sugar mixtures using Escherichia coli catabolite repression mutants engineered for production of L-lactic acid,"Dien, B. S., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.7000299,"Conversion of lignocellulose to lactic acid requires strains capable of fermenting sugar mixtures of glucose and xylose. Recombinant Escherichia coli strains were engineered to selectively produce L-lactic acid and then used to ferment sugar mixtures. Three of these strains were catabolite repression mutants (ptsG(-)) that have the ability to simultaneously ferment glucose and xylose. The best results were obtained for ptsG(-) strain FBR19. FBR19 cultures had a yield of 0.77 (g lactic acid/g added sugar) when used to ferment a 100 g/l total equal mixture of glucose and xylose. The strain also consumed 75% of the xylose. In comparison, the ptsG(+) strains had yields of 0.47-0.48 g/g and consumed 18-22% of the xylose. FBR19 was subsequently used to ferment a variety of glucose (0-40 g/l) and xylose (40 g/l) mixtures. The lactic acid yields ranged from 0.74 to 1.00 g/g. Further experiments were conducted to discover the mechanism leading to the poor yields for ptsG(+) strains. Xylose isomerase (XI) activity, a marker for induction of xylose metabolism, was monitored for FBR19 and a ptsG(+) control during fermentations of a sugar mixture. Crude protein extracts prepared from FBR19 had 10-12 times the specific XI activity of comparable samples from ptsG(+) strains. Therefore, higher expression of xylose metabolic genes in the ptsG(-) strain may be responsible for superior conversion of xylose to product compared to the ptsG(+) fermentations."

It is one of the few amino acids that is not produced on a large scale by microbial fermentation due to the lack of an efficient microbial cell factory. In this study, we demonstrated the engineering of wild-type Escherichia coli to overproduce histidine from glucose. First, removal of transcription attenuation and histidine-mediated feedback inhibition resulted in 0.8 g/L histidine accumulation. Second, chromosome-based optimization of the expression levels of histidine biosynthesis genes led to a 4.75-fold increase in histidine titer. Third, strengthening phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate supply and rerouting the purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway improved the histidine production to 8.2 g/L. Fourth, introduction of the NADH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis and the lysine exporter from Corynebacterium glutamicum enabled the final strain HW6-3 to produce 11.8 g/L histidine. Finally, 66.5 g/L histidine was produced under fed-batch fermentation, with a yield of 0.23 g/g glucose and a productivity of 1.5 g/L/h. This is the highest titer and productivity of histidine ever reported from an engineered strain.

This nonphosphorylative metabolism is orthogonal to the intrinsic pentose metabolism in Escherichia coli and has fewer enzymatic steps and a higher theoretical yield to TCA cycle intermediates than the pentose phosphate pathway. Here mesaconate production was enabled from the d-xylose pathway and the l-arabinose pathway. To enhance the transportation of d-xylose and l-arabinose, pentose transporters were examined. We identified the pentose/proton symporter, AraE, as the most effective transporter for both d-xylose and l-arabinose in mesaconate production process.

Constructing an ethanol utilization pathway in Escherichia coli to produce acetyl-CoA derived compounds,"Liang, H., et al.",Metab Eng,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.11.010,"Engineering microbes to utilize non-conventional substrates could create short and efficient pathways to convert substrate into product. In this study, we designed and constructed a two-step heterologous ethanol utilization pathway (EUP) in Escherichia coli by using acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (encoded by ada) from Dickeya zeae and alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded by adh2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This EUP can convert ethanol into acetyl-CoA without ATP consumption, and generate two molecules of NADH per molecule of ethanol. We optimized the expression of these two genes and found that ethanol consumption could be improved by expressing them in a specific order (ada-adh2) with a constitutive promoter (PgyrA). The engineered E. coli strain with EUP consumed approximately 8 g/L of ethanol in 96 h when it was used as sole carbon source. Subsequently, we combined EUP with the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable polymer derived from acetyl-CoA.

Homofermentative production of optically pure L-lactic acid from xylose by genetically engineered Escherichia coli B,"Zhao, J., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-12-57,"BACKGROUND: Polylactic acid (PLA), a biodegradable polymer, has the potential to replace (at least partially) traditional petroleum-based plastics, minimizing white pollution. However, cost-effective production of optically pure L-lactic acid is needed to achieve the full potential of PLA. Currently, starch-based glucose is used for L-lactic acid fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. Due to its competition with food resources, an alternative non-food substrate such as cellulosic biomass is needed for L-lactic acid fermentation. Nevertheless, the substrate (sugar stream) derived from cellulosic biomass contains significant amounts of xylose, which is unfermentable by most lactic acid bacteria. However, the microorganisms that do ferment xylose usually carry out heterolactic acid fermentation. As a result, an alternative strain should be developed for homofermentative production of optically pure L-lactic acid using cellulosic biomass. RESULTS: In this study, an ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain, SZ470 (DeltafrdBC DeltaldhA DeltaackA DeltapflB DeltapdhR ::pflBp6-acEF-lpd DeltamgsA), was reengineered for homofermentative production of L-lactic acid from xylose (1.2 mole xylose = > 2 mole L-lactic acid), by deleting the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE) and integrating the L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) of Pediococcus acidilactici. The resulting strain, WL203, was metabolically evolved further through serial transfers in screw-cap tubes containing xylose, resulting in the strain WL204 with improved anaerobic cell growth. When tested in 70 g L-1 xylose fermentation (complex medium), WL204 produced 62 g L-1 L-lactic acid, with a maximum production rate of 1.631 g L-1 h-1 and a yield of 97% based on xylose metabolized. HPLC analysis using a chiral column showed that an L-lactic acid optical purity of 99.5% was achieved by WL204. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that WL204 has the potential for homofermentative production of L-lactic acid using cellulosic biomass derived substrates, which contain a significant amount of xylose."
Photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus helveticus by ZnO and TiO2 activated with ultraviolet light,TCK Yang,Process Biochemistry,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0032-9592(03)00084-0,"The photocatalytic inactivation of Gram negative Escherichia coli and Gram positive Lactobacillus helveticus by both TiO2 and ZnO with 365-nm ultraviolet (UV) light was studied in a batch reactor. Almost all the initial E. coli cell (108 CFU/ml) were inactivated in 40 min in the presence of 2 g/l ZnO. Photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria was found to follow first order kinetics with the highest rate constants being 4.5Ã10â1 and 2.2Ã10â1/min for E. coli and L. Helveticus, respectively, treated with 2 g/l ZnO. A similar bactericidal tendency was found in the UVâTiO2 system, where the rate constants were 3.7Ã10â1 and 1.8Ã10â1/min for E. coli and L. Helveticus, respectively. The use of air as the purging gas, providing a stronger oxidising environment to both strains, gives a higher catalytic effect on bacteria inactivation than that of nitrogen."
Effect of amplification of desensitized purF and prs on inosine accumulation in Escherichia coli,"Shimaoka, M., et al.",J Biosci Bioeng,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1263/jbb.103.255,"The effect of a phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase gene (prs) that was desensitized to feedback inhibition by ADP on inosine accumulation was investigated using an inosine-producing mutant of Escherichia coli. At the same time, various types of plasmid having a PRPP amidotransferase gene (purF) that was desensitized to feedback inhibition by AMP and GMP were also investigated to improve inosine productivity using a compatible plasmid containing prs with a plasmid containing purF. The recombinant E. coli I-9 harboring a low-copy-number plasmid having the desensitized-purF (pMWKQ) accumulated 3.6 g/l inosine from 40 g/l glucose in a 2-d culture. Furthermore, desensitized-prs amplification, in addition to purF, resulted in the accumulation of 6.2 g/l inosine. Additionally, through these experiments, a spontaneous mutant with an enhanced inosine-producing ability compared with the parent strain I-9 was obtained. The spontaneous mutant I-9m harboring only pMWKQ and I-9m harboring both pMWKQ and pSTVDA (a plasmid having the desensitized-prs) accumulated 6.7 g/l and 7.5 g/l inosine, respectively, from 40 g/l glucose in a 3-d culture."
Butyrate production in engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic scaffolds,"Baek, J. M., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.24925,"Butyrate pathway was constructed in recombinant Escherichia coli using the genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Treponema denticola. However, the pathway constructed from exogenous enzymes did not efficiently convert carbon flux to butyrate. Three steps of the productivity enhancement were attempted in this study. First, pathway engineering to delete metabolic pathways to by-products successfully improved the butyrate production. Second, synthetic scaffold protein that spatially co-localizes enzymes was introduced to improve the efficiency of the heterologous pathway enzymes, resulting in threefold improvement in butyrate production. Finally, further optimizations of inducer concentrations and pH adjustment were tried. The final titer of butyrate was 4.3 and 7.2 g/L under batch and fed-batch cultivation, respectively. This study demonstrated the importance of synthetic scaffold protein as a useful tool for optimization of heterologous butyrate pathway in E. coli."

A novel 2-pyrrolidone synthase, ORF27, from Streptomyces aizunensis was identified to catalyze the ring closing dehydration of gamma-aminobutyrate. ORF27's tendency to aggregate was resolved by expression at low temperature and fusion to the maltose binding protein (MBP). Recombinant Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for the production of 2-pyrrolidone from glutamate by expressing both the genes encoding GadB, a glutamate decarboxylase, and ORF27. Incorporation of a GadB mutant lacking H465 and T466, GadB_DeltaHT, improved the efficiency of one-pot 2-pyrrolidone biosynthesis in vivo. When the recombinant E. coli strain expressing the E. coli GadB_DeltaHT mutant and the ORF27-MBP fusion was cultured in ZYM-5052 medium containing 9 g/L of l-glutamate, 7.7 g/L of l-glutamate was converted to 1.1 g/L of 2-pyrrolidone within 31 h, achieving 25% molar yield from the consumed substrate."

Xylose-only fermentation of the tested ethanologenic bacteria are five to eight times faster than 424A(LNH-ST) in the CSL fermentation. All tested strains grow and co-ferment sugars at 15% w/v solids loading equivalent of ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX)-pretreated corn stover water extract. However, both KO11 and 424A(LNH-ST) exhibit higher growth robustness than AX101. In 18% w/w solids loading lignocellulosic hydrolysate from AFEX pretreatment, complete glucose fermentations can be achieved at a rate greater than 0.77 g/L/h.

Designing a Highly Efficient Biosynthetic Route for Lacto-N-Neotetraose Production in Escherichia coli,"Zhang, P., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04416,"Recently, the biosynthesis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) has been attracting increasing attention. Lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) is one of the most important neutral-core HMOs with promising health effects for infants. It has received Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status and is the second HMO commercially added in infant formula after 2'-fucosyllactose. In previous studies, a series of engineered Escherichia coli strains have been constructed and optimized to produce high titers of precursor lacto-N-triose II. On the basis of these strains, LNnT-producing strains were constructed by overexpressing the beta1,4-galactosyltransferase-encoding gene from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans NUM4039 (Aa-beta1,4-GalT). Interestingly, an appreciable LNnT titer was obtained by weakening the metabolic flux of the UDP-GlcNAc pathway and simply overexpressing the essential genes lgtA, galE, and Aa-beta1,4-GalT in lacZ-, wecB-, and nagB-deleted E. coli. Subsequently, LNnT synthesis was optimized through balancing the expression of these three biosynthetic enzymes. The optimized strain produced LNnT with an extracellular titer of 12.1 g/L in fed-batch cultivation, with the productivity and specific yield of 0.25 g/L.h and 0.27 g/g dry cell weight, respectively."
Glucose metabolism at high density growth of E. coli B and E. coli K: Differences in metabolic pathways are responsible for efficient glucose utilization in E. coli B as â¦,"JN Phue, SB Noronha, R Hattacharyyaâ¦",Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.20478,"In a series of previous reports it was established by implementing metabolic flux, NMR/MS, and Northern blot analysis that the glyoxylate shunt, the TCA cycle, and acetate uptake by acetyl-CoA synthetase are more active in Escherichia coli BL21 than in Escherichia coli JM109. These differences were accepted as the reason for the differences in the glucose metabolism and acetate excretion of these two strains. Examination of the bacterial metabolism by microarrays and time course Northern blot showed that in addition to the glyoxylate shunt, the TCA cycle and the acetate uptake, other metabolic pathways are active differently in the two strains. These are gluconeogenesis, sfcA shunt, ppc shunt, glycogen biosynthesis, and fatty acid degradation. It was found that in E. coli JM109, acetate is produced by pyruvate oxidase (poxB) using pyruvate as a substrate rather than by phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (Pta-AckA) system which uses acetyl-CoA. The inactivation of the gluconeogenesis enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (ppsA), the activation of the anaplerotic sfcA shunt, and low and stable pyruvate dehydrogenase (aceE, aceF) cause pyruvate accumulation which is converted to acetate by pyruvate oxidase B. The behavior of the ppsA, acs, and aceBAK in JM109 was dependent on the glucose supply strategy. When the glucose concentration was high, no transcription of these genes was observed and acetate concentration increased, but at low glucose concentrations these genes were expressed and the acetate concentration decreased. It is possible that there is a major regulatory molecule that controls not only ppsA and aceBAK but also acs. The gluconeogenesis pathway (fbp, pckA, and ppsA) which leads to glycogen accumulation is constitutively active in E. coli BL21 regardless of glucose feeding strategy.

First, cadaverine degradation and utilization pathways were inactivated. Next, L-lysine decarboxylase, which converts L-lysine directly to cadaverine, was amplified by plasmid-based overexpression of the cadA gene under the strong tac promoter.

Utility of an Escherichia coli strain engineered in the substrate uptake system for improved culture performance at high glucose and cell concentrations: An alternative â¦,"AR Lara, L Caspeta, G Gosset, F BolÃ­var",Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.21664,"Overflow metabolism is an undesirable characteristic of aerobic cultures of Escherichia coli. It results from elevated glucose consumption rates that cause a high substrate conversion to acetate, severely affecting cell physiology and bioprocess performance. Such phenomenon typically occurs in batch cultures under high glucose concentration. Fed-batch culture, where glucose uptake rate is controlled by external addition of glucose, is the classical bioprocessing alternative to prevent overflow metabolism. Despite its wide-spread use, fed-batch mode presents drawbacks that could be overcome by simpler batch cultures at high initial glucose concentration, only if overflow metabolism is effectively prevented. In this study, an E. coli strain (VH32) lacking the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) with a modified glucose transport system was cultured at glucose concentrations of up to 100 g/L in batch mode, while expressing the recombinant green fluorescence protein (GFP). At the highest glucose concentration tested, acetate accumulated to a maximum of 13.6 g/L for the parental strain (W3110), whereas a maximum concentration of only 2 g/L was observed for VH32. Consequently, high cell and GFP concentrations of 52 and 8.2 g/L, respectively, were achieved in VH32 cultures at 100 g/L of glucose. In contrast, maximum biomass and GFP in W3110 cultures only reached 65 and 48%, respectively, of the values attained by the engineered strain. A comparison of this culture strategy against traditional fed-batch culture of W3110 is presented. This study shows that high cell and recombinant protein concentrations are attainable in simple batch cultures by circumventing overflow metabolism through metabolic engineering. This represents a novel and valuable alternative to classical bioprocessing approaches. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2008;99: 893â901. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

One-way analysis was used to approximate the optimal ranges for these factors, followed by a full factorial design to quantify the effects of each factor and the interactions between the factors. Initial succinate, glucose, and IPTG concentration were observed to be the key factors affecting ALA synthase activity with the optimal levels determined to be above 6 g/l succinate, 0 g/l glucose, and 0.10 mM IPTG. ALA synthase activity was generally lower with AFP111 than with MG1655, and the effect of these three key factors was also lower with AFP111 than with MG1655.

Model-based metabolic engineering enables high yield itaconic acid production by Escherichia coli,"K Bettenbrock, S Klamt",Metabolic engineering,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2016.05.008,"We introduced a plasmid (pCadCS) carrying genes for itaconic acid production into E. coli and applied a model-based approach to construct a high yield production strain. Based on the concept of minimal cut sets, we identified intervention strategies that guarantee high itaconic acid yield while still allowing growth. One cut set was selected and the corresponding genes were iteratively knocked-out. As a conceptual novelty, we pursued an adaptive approach allowing changes in the model and initially calculated intervention strategy if a genetic modification induces changes in byproduct formation. Using this approach, we iteratively implemented five interventions leading to high yield itaconic acid production in minimal medium with glucose as substrate supplemented with small amounts of glutamic acid.

Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for efficient production of l-arginine,"HD Wang, JZ Xu, WG Zhang",Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-022-12109-4,"As an important semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg) has important application prospects in medicine and health care. However, it remains a challenge to efficiently produce L-Arg by Escherichia coli (E. coli). In the present study, we obtained an E. coli A1 with L-Arg accumulation ability, and carried out a series of metabolic engineering on it, and finally obtained an E. coli strain A7 with high L-Arg production ability. First, genome analysis of strain A1 was performed to explore the related genes affecting L-Arg accumulation. We found that gene speC and gene speF played an important role in the accumulation of L-Arg. Second, we used two strategies to solve the feedback inhibition of the L-Arg pathway in E. coli. One was the combination of a mutation of the gene argA and the deletion of the gene argR, and the other was the combination of a heterologous insertion of the gene argJ and the deletion of the gene argR. The combination of exogenous argJ gene insertion and argR gene deletion achieved higher titer accumulation with less impact on strain growth. Finally, we inserted the gene cluster argCJBDF of Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) to enhance the metabolic flux of the L-Arg pathway in E. coli. The final strain obtained 70.1 g/L L-Arg in a 5-L bioreactor, with a yield of 0.326 g/g glucose and a productivity of 1.17 g/(L· h).

Aerobic fermentations with these two strains were completed to catalog physiological states during aerobic growth that might influence succinate generation in the anaerobic phase. Activities of six key enzymes were also determined for these aerobic fermentations. From these results, six transition times based on physiological states were selected for studying dual-phase fermentations. The final succinate yield and productivity depend greatly on the physiological state of the cells at the time of transition. Using the best transition time, fermentations achieved a final succinic acid concentration of 99.2 g/l with an overall yield of 110% and productivity of 1.3 g/l h."

The engineered strain with ethanol utilization capacity could consume approximately 8.0 g/L of ethanol within 48 h when using 10 g/L of ethanol as the carbon source.

When NZN111(pTrcML) was cultured at 30 degrees C with intermittent glucose feeding the final succinic acid concentration obtained was 9.5 g/L and the ratio of succinic acid to acetic acid was 13:1. This system could not be analyzed by conventional metabolic flux analysis techniques, since some pyruvate and succinic acid were accumulated intracellularly.

The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis pathway was strengthened, and beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LgtA) was introduced to construct an LNT II-producing base strain. To increase the titer and yield of LNT II, combinatorial optimization of the copy number and the ribosomal binding site sequence was performed to tune the gene expression strength and translation rates of the pathway enzymes. Next, multipoint mutations were introduced to glucosamine-6-phosphatesynthase (GlmS) to relieve the feedback inhibition. Then, a series of engineered strains were constructed by blocking the futile pathways by the deletion of the relevant genes. Finally, the culture conditions were optimized. LNT II titer was improved step-by-step from 0.53 to 5.52 g/L in shake-flask cultivations. Fed-batch culture of the final engineered strain produced 46.2 g/L of LNT II, with an LNT II productivity and content of 0.77 g/(L.h) and 0.95 g/g dry cell weight, respectively."

Each fractional component was assayed over a 24-h period with 5-log initial inocula to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and log CFU/ml reductions, at their native pH and neutral pH. Each fraction produced significant reductions (P < 0.05) at the native pH: MICs for sugars plus organic, phenolics, and anthocyanins were 5.6/2.6 Brix/acid (citric acid equivalents) 2.70 g/L (gallic acid equivalent), and 14.80 mg/L (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalent), respectively. Sugars plus organic acids at native pH (3) produced a reduction below detectable limits (< 1 log CFU/ml) compared to the control at 24 h for 11.3/5.2 and 5.6/2.6 Brix/acid. Phenolics at native pH (4) produced reductions below detectable limits compared to the control at 24 h and initial inocula for treatments of 5.40 and 2.70 g/L. Anthocyanins at native pH (2) produced reductions below detectable limits for treatments of 29.15 and 14.80 mg/L cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents. Neutralized phenolics and anthocyanins had the same MIC and MBC as those at their native pH. Neutralized sugars plus organic acids did not inhibit bacterial growth compared to the control. Neutralized phenolics reduced bacteria below detectable limits in treatments of 5.40 g/L and 2.70 g/L compared to the control. Neutralized anthocyanins reduced bacterial growth below detectable limits at the concentration of 29.15 mg/L, but at 14.80 mg/L there was no significant reduction. Stationary-phase cells of E. coli O157:H7 were treated with 5% of each fraction in 0.8% NaCl for 20 min and viewed under transmission electron microscopy. All fractions caused significant damage compared the control. Sugars plus organic acids caused visible osmotic stress, while phenolics and anthocyanins caused disintegration of the outer membrane."
Biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates from sucrose by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains,"Sohn, Y. J., et al.",Int J Biol Macromol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.01.254,"Sucrose utilization has been established in Escherichia coli strains by expression of Mannheimia succiniciproducens beta-fructofuranosidase (SacC), which hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Recombinant E. coli strains that can utilize sucrose were examined for their abilities to produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] from sucrose. When recombinant E. coli strains expressing Ralstonia eutropha PhaCAB and SacC were cultured in MR medium containing 20 g/L of sucrose, all recombinant E. coli strains could produce P(3HB) from sucrose. Also, recombinant E. coli strains expressing Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 PhaC1437, Clostridium propionicum Pct540, R. eutropha PhaAB enzymes along with SacC could produce P(3HB-co-LA) from sucrose. Among the examined E. coli strains, recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue produced the highest contents of P(3HB) (53.60 +/- 2.55 wt%) and P(3HB-co-LA) (29.44 +/- 0.39 wt%). In the batch fermentations, recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue strains completely consumed 20 g/L of sucrose as the sole carbon source and supported the production of 3.76 g/L of P(3HB) and 1.82 g/L of P(3HB-co-LA) with 38.21 wt% P(3HB) and 20.88 wt% P(3HB-co-LA) contents, respectively. Recombinant E. coli strains developed in this study can be used to establish a cost-efficient biorefinery for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from sucrose, which is an abundant and inexpensive carbon source."
Increasing l-threonine production in Escherichia coli by engineering the glyoxylate shunt and the l-threonine biosynthesis pathway,"H Zhao, Y Fang, X Wang, L Zhao, J Wangâ¦",Applied microbiology and Biotechnology,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9024-3,"L-threonine is an important amino acid that can be added in food, medicine, or feed. Here, the influence of glyoxylate shunt on an L-threonine producing strain Escherichia coli TWF001 has been studied. The gene iclR was deleted, and the native promoter of the aceBA operon was replaced by the trc promoter in the chromosome of TWF001, the resulting strainTWF004 could produce 0.39 g L-threonine from1 g glucose after 36-h flask cultivation. Further replacing the native promoter of aspC by the trc promoter in the chromosome of TWF004 resulted in the strain TWF006. TWF006 could produce 0.42 g L-threonine from 1 g glucose after 36-h flask cultivation. Three key genes in the biosynthetic pathway of L-threonine, thrA* (a mutated thrA), thrB, and thrC were overexpressed in TWF006, resulting the strain TWF006/pFW01-thrA*BC.

Directing vanillin production from ferulic acid by increased acetylâCoA consumption in recombinant Escherichia coli,SH Yoon,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.22040,"The amplification of gltA gene encoding citrate synthase of TCA cycle was required for the efficient conversion of acetyl-CoA, generated during vanillin production from ferulic acid, to CoA, which is essential for vanillin production. Vanillin of 1.98 g/L was produced from the E. coli DH5Î± (pTAHEF-gltA) with gltA amplification in 48 h of culture at 3.0 g/L of ferulic acid, which was about twofold higher than the vanillin production of 0.91 g/L obtained by the E. coli DH5Î± (pTAHEF) without gltA amplification. The icdA gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase of TCA cycle was deleted to make the vanillin producing E. coli utilize glyoxylate bypass which enables more efficient conversion of acetyl-CoA to CoA in comparison with TCA cycle. The production of vanillin by the icdA null mutant of E. coli BW25113 harboring pTAHEF was enhanced by 2.6 times. The gltA amplification of the glyoxylate bypass in the icdA null mutant remarkably increased the production rate of vanillin with a little increase in the amount of vanillin production. The real synergistic effect of gltA amplification and icdA deletion was observed with use of XAD-2 resin reducing the toxicity of vanillin produced during culture. Vanillin of 5.14 g/L was produced in 24 h of the culture with molar conversion yield of 86.6%, which is the highest so far in vanillin production from ferulic acid using recombinant E. coli.

High-yield production of L-valine in engineered Escherichia coli by a novel two-stage fermentation,"Hao, Y., et al.",Metab Eng,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.09.007,"L-valine is an essential amino acid and an important amino acid in the food and feed industry. The relatively low titer and low fermentation yield currently limit the large-scale application of L-valine. Here, we constructed a chromosomally engineered Escherichia coli to efficiently produce L-valine. First, the synthetic pathway of L-valine was enhanced by heterologous introduction of a feedback-resistant acetolactate acid synthase from Bacillus subtilis and overexpression of other two enzymes in the L-valine synthetic pathway. For efficient efflux of L-valine, an exporter from Corynebacterium glutamicum was subsequently introduced. Next, the precursor pyruvate pool was increased by knockout of GTP pyrophosphokinase and introduction of a ppGpp 3'-pyrophosphohydrolase mutant to facilitate the glucose uptake process. Finally, in order to improve the redox cofactor balance, acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase was replaced by a NADH-preferring mutant, and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase was replaced by leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis. Redox cofactor balance enabled the strain to synthesize L-valine under oxygen-limiting condition, significantly increasing the yield in the presence of glucose. Two-stage fed-batch fermentation of the final strain in a 5 L bioreactor produced 84 g/L L-valine with a yield and productivity of 0.41 g/g glucose and 2.33 g/L/h, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest L-valine titer and yield ever reported in E. coli. The systems metabolic engineering strategy described here will be useful for future engineering of E. coli strains for the industrial production of L-valine and related products."
Highly efficient production of L-homoserine in Escherichia coli by engineering a redox balance route,"Mu, Q., et al.",Metab Eng,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2021.07.011,"L-Homoserine is a nonessential chiral amino acid and the precursor of L-threonine and L-methionine. It has great potential to be used in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, cosmetic, and fragrance industries. However, the current low efficiency in the fermentation process of L-homoserine drives up the cost and therefore limits applications. Here, we systematically analyzed the L-homoserine production network in Escherichia coli to design a redox balance route for L-homoserine fermentation from glucose. Production of L-homoserine from L-aspartate via reduction of the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate oxaloacetate lacks reducing power. This deficiency could be corrected by activating the glyoxylate shunt and driving the flux from fumarate to L-aspartate with excess reducing power. This redox balance route decreases cell growth pressure and the theoretical yield of L-homoserine is 1.5 mol/mol of glucose without carbon loss. We fine-tuned the flux from fumarate to L-aspartate, deleted competitive and degradative pathways, enhanced L-homoserine efflux, and generated 84.1 g/L L-homoserine with 1.96 g/L/h productivity and 0.50 g/g glucose yield in a fed-batch fermentation. This study proposes a novel balanced redox metabolic network strategy for highly efficient production of L-homoserine and its derivative amino acids."

High level production of tyrosinase in recombinant Escherichia coli,"Ren, Q., et al.",BMC Biotechnol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-13-18,"BACKGROUND: Tyrosinase is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the hydroxylation of monophenols to o-diphenols (monophenolase activity) and the subsequent oxidation of the diphenols to o-quinones (diphenolase activity). Due to the potential applications of tyrosinase in biotechnology, in particular in biocatalysis and for biosensors, it is desirable to develop a suitable low-cost process for efficient production of this enzyme. So far, the best production yield reported for tyrosinase was about 1 g L(-1), which was achieved by cultivating the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei for 6 days. RESULTS: In this work, tyrosinase from Verrucomicrobium spinosum was expressed in Escherichia coli and its production was studied in both batch and fed-batch cultivations. Effects of various key cultivation parameters on tyrosinase production were first examined in batch cultures to identify optimal conditions. It was found that a culture temperature of 32 degrees C and induction at the late growth stage were favorable, leading to a highest tyrosinase activity of 0.76 U mL(-1). The fed-batch process was performed by using an exponential feeding strategy to achieve high cell density. With the fed-batch process, a final biomass concentration of 37 g L(-1) (based on optical density) and a tyrosinase activity of 13 U mL(-1) were obtained in 28 hours, leading to a yield of active tyrosinase of about 3 g L(-1). The highest overall volumetric productivity of 103 mg of active tyrosinase per liter and hour (corresponding to 464 mU L(-1) h(-1)) was determined, which is approximately 15 times higher than that obtained in batch cultures. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully expressed and produced gram quantities per liter of active tyrosinase in recombinant E. coli by optimizing the expression conditions and fed-batch cultivation strategy. Exponential feed of substrate helped to prolong the exponential phase of growth, to reduce the fermentation time and thus the cost. A specific tyrosinase production rate of 103 mg L(-1) h(-1) and a maximum volumetric activity of 464 mU L(-1) h(-1) were achieved in this study. These levels have not been reported previously."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of malic acid,"TY Kim, SY Lee",Biochemical Engineering Journal,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2008.01.001,"Malic acid is a C4-dicarboxylic acid and an intermediate of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It has been widely used in the polymer, food and pharmaceutical industries. Metabolic flux analysis was performed to find a strategy for enhanced malic acid production in Escherichia coli. The simulation results suggested that the amplification of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation flux allowed increased malic acid production. Since the PEP carboxylase of E. coli converts PEP to oxaloacetate without generating ATP, thus losing the high-energy phosphate bond of PEP, the PEP carboxykinase, which generates ATP during this conversion, was chosen. However, the E. coli PEP carboxykinase catalyzes the reaction that converts oxaloacetate to PEP rather than the desirable opposite reaction. Thus, we cloned the PEP carboxykinase (enconded by the pckA gene) of Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which converts PEP to oxaloacetate as a favorable reaction. The pta mutant E. coli strain WGS-10 harboring the plasmid p104ManPck containing the M. succiniciproducens pckA gene was constructed and cultured at 37 °C. The final malic acid concentration of 9.25 g/L could be obtained after 12 h of aerobic cultivation."

A Gram-Scale Limonene Production Process with Engineered Escherichia coli,"Rolf, J., et al.",Molecules,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25081881,"Monoterpenes, such as the cyclic terpene limonene, are valuable and important natural products widely used in food, cosmetics, household chemicals, and pharmaceutical applications. The biotechnological production of limonene with microorganisms may complement traditional plant extraction methods. For this purpose, the bioprocess needs to be stable and ought to show high titers and space-time yields. In this study, a limonene production process was developed with metabolically engineered Escherichia coli at the bioreactor scale. Therefore, fed-batch fermentations in minimal medium and in the presence of a non-toxic organic phase were carried out with E. coli BL21 (DE3) pJBEI-6410 harboring the optimized genes for the mevalonate pathway and the limonene synthase from Mentha spicata on a single plasmid. The feasibility of glycerol as the sole carbon source for cell growth and limonene synthesis was examined, and it was applied in an optimized fermentation setup. Titers on a gram-scale of up to 7.3 g.L(org)(-1) (corresponding to 3.6 g.L(-1) in the aqueous production phase) were achieved with industrially viable space-time yields of 0.15 g.L(-1).h(-1). These are the highest monoterpene concentrations obtained with a microorganism to date, and these findings provide the basis for the development of an economic and industrially relevant bioprocess."
Engineering pyridoxal kinase PdxY-integrated Escherichia coli strain and optimization for high-level 5-aminolevulinic acid production,IS Ng,Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtice.2021.03.017,"Recently, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has gained significant attention in research due to its extensive applications in agriculture, aquaculture, cosmetics, and photodynamic therapy for cancer. Microbial production of ALA is a green, high-efficient, and sustainable process. Herein, we have engineered a new strain of Escherichia coli called PdxY Integrative E. coli Enhancer (PIECE). In this strain, the super salvage pathway was fine-tuned to enhance the regeneration of pyridoxal 5â²-phosphate (PLP), on which the activity of ALA synthase (ALAS) is highly dependent. The PIECE strain, harboring ALA synthase (ALAS) from Rhodobacter capsulatus, produced 1.99 g/L ALA and 5.15 g/L biomass, that was a 4.33-fold increase in ALA production and a 1.84-fold increase in biomass compared to the parent strain. The metabolic flux analysis indicated that PIECE would redirect more carbon into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and generate more glycine and glutamate, thereby increasing the ALA and biomass. Finally, the maximum ALA yield of 8.21 g/L and a productivity of 0.228 g/L/h were obtained by using fed-batch fermentation. The results showed that PIECE was not only feasible for high-level ALA production but also had significant potential to reprogram the carbon flux in the TCA cycle to produce value-added chemicals in the future."
Expression and purification of mini G proteins from Escherichia coli,CG Tate,Bio-protocol,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.2235,"Heterotrimeric G proteins modulate intracellular signalling by transducing information from cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to cytoplasmic effector proteins. Structural and functional characterisation of GPCRâG protein complexes is important to fully decipher the mechanism of signal transduction.

We therefore developed an engineered minimal G protein, mini-Gs, which formed a stable complex with GPCRs, and facilitated the crystallisation and structure determination of the human adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) in its active conformation. Mini G proteins are potentially useful tools in a variety of applications, including characterising GPCR pharmacology, binding affinity and kinetic experiments, agonist drug discovery, and structure determination of GPCRâG protein complexes.

However, the plasmid losing was to blame for the wildly fluctuating fermentation performance of engineered strains, ranging between 2.1 and 6.2âg/L. Then, a hok/sok toxin/antitoxin system was introduced into the free plasmid expression cassette to maintain the genetic stability of the episomal plasmid; consequently, the plasmid-losing rate sharply decreased, resulting in the engineered strain SHL17, which exhibited excellent stability in l-homoserine production, with 6.3âg/L in shake flasks and 44.4âg/L in a 5-L fermenter without antibiotic addition.

Although glucose has been extensively studied as the substrate for malate production, its high price and potential competition with food production are serious limiting factors. In this study, Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to effectively produce malate from xylose, the second most abundant sugar component of lignocellulosic biomass. First, the biosynthetic route of malate was constructed by overexpressing D-tagatose 3-epimerase, L-fuculokinase, L-fuculose-phosphate aldolase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase A. Second, genes encoding malic enzyme, malate dehydrogenase, and fumarate hydratase were knocked out to eliminate malate consumption, resulting in a titer of 1.99â¯g/l malate and a yield of 0.47â¯g malate/g xylose. Third, glycolate oxidase and malate synthase were overexpressed to strengthen the conversion of glycolate to malate, which led to a titer of 4.33â¯g/l malate and a yield of 0.83â¯g malate/g xylose, reaching 93% of the theoretical yield. Finally, catalase HPII was overexpressed to decompose H(2)O(2) and alleviate its toxicity, which improved cell growth and further boosted malate titer to 5.90â¯g/l with a yield of 0.80â¯g malate/g xylose.

The engineered strain, TRTH0709 carrying pSV709, produced 35.9âg/L tryptophan from glucose after 40âh in fed-batch cultivation. The two genes were inserted, independently or together, into a low-copy-number expression vector (pSTV28) and transferred to TRTH0709. Fed-batch fermentations at high cell densities of the recombination strains revealed that overexpression of the ppsA gene alone does not significantly increase tryptophan yield. On the other hand, overexpression of the tktA gene, alone or with the ppsA gene, could further improve tryptophan yield to a final tryptophan titer of 37.9 and 40.2âg/L, respectively. These results represent a 5.6% and 11.9% enhancement over the titer achieved by TRTH0709. No evident genetic modifications leading to growth impairment were observed."
Growth and recombinant protein expression with Escherichia coli in different batch cultivation media,"Hortsch, R. and D. Weuster-Botz",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-3036-y,"Parallel operated milliliter-scale stirred tank bioreactors were applied for recombinant protein expression studies in simple batch experiments without pH titration. An enzymatic glucose release system (EnBase), a complex medium, and the frequently used LB and TB media were compared with regard to growth of Escherichia coli and recombinant protein expression (alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Lactobacillus brevis and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii). Dissolved oxygen and pH were recorded online, optical densities were measured at-line, and the activities of ADH and FDH were analyzed offline. Best growth was observed in a complex medium with maximum dry cell weight concentrations of 14 g L(-1). EnBase cultivations enabled final dry cell weight concentrations between 6 and 8 g L(-1). The pH remained nearly constant in EnBase cultivations due to the continuous glucose release, showing the usefulness of this glucose release system especially for pH-sensitive bioprocesses. Cell-specific enzyme activities varied considerably depending on the different media used. Maximum specific ADH activities were measured with the complex medium, 6 h after induction with IPTG, whereas the highest specific FDH activities were achieved with the EnBase medium at low glucose release profiles 24 h after induction. Hence, depending on the recombinant protein, different medium compositions, times for induction, and times for cell harvest have to be evaluated to achieve efficient expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A rapid experimental evaluation can easily be performed with parallel batch operated small-scale stirred tank bioreactors."
Pathway construction and metabolic engineering for fermentative production of Î²-alanine in Escherichia coli,"X Zou, L Guo, L Huang, M Li, S Zhang, A Yangâ¦",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10359-8,"Î²-Alanine is a naturally occurring Î²-amino acid that has been widely applied in the life and health field. Although microbial fermentation is a promising method for industrial production of Î²-alanine, an efficient microbial cell factory is still lacking. In this study, a new metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain for Î²-alanine production was developed through a series of introduction, deletion, and overexpression of genes involved in its biosynthesis pathway. First, the L-aspartate a-decarboxylase gene, BtADC, from Bacillus tequilensis, with higher catalytic activity to produce Î²-alanine from aspartate, was constitutively expressed in E. coli, leading to an increased production of Î²-alanine up to 2.76 g/L. Second, three native aspartate kinase genes, akI, akII, and akIII, were knocked out to promote the production of Î²-alanine to a higher concentration of 4.43 g/L by preventing from bypass loss of aspartate. To increase the amount of aspartate, the native AspC gene was replaced with PaeAspDH, a L-aspartate dehydrogenase gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accompanied with the overexpression of the native AspA gene, to further improve the production level of Î²-alanine to 9.27 g/L. Last, increased biosynthesis of oxaloacetic acid (OAA) was achieved by a combination of overexpression of the native PPC, introduction of CgPC, a pyruvate decarboxylase from Corynebacterium glutamicum, and deletion of ldhA, pflB, pta, and adhE in E. coli, to further enhance the production of Î²-alanine. Finally, the engineered E. coli strain produced 43.12 g/L Î²-alanine in fed-batch fermentation. Our study will lay a solid foundation for the promising application of Î²-alanine in the life and health field."
Efficient Biofilm-Based Fermentation Strategies for L-Threonine Production by Escherichia coli,"Chen, T., et al.",Front Microbiol,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01773,"Biofilms provide cells favorable growth conditions, which have been exploited in industrial biotechnological processes. However, industrial application of the biofilm has not yet been reported in Escherichia coli, one of the most important platform strains, though the biofilm has been extensively studied for pathogenic reasons. Here, we engineered E. coli by overexpressing the fimH gene, which successfully enhanced its biofilm formation under industrial aerobic cultivation conditions. Subsequently, a biofilm-based immobilized fermentation strategy was developed. L-threonine production was increased from 10.5 to 14.1 g/L during batch fermentations and further to 17.5 g/L during continuous (repeated-batch) fermentations with enhanced productivities. Molecular basis for the enhanced biofilm formation and L-threonine biosynthesis was also studied by transcriptome analysis. This study goes beyond the conventional research focusing on pathogenic aspects of E. coli biofilm and represents a successful application case of engineered E. coli biofilm to industrial processes."

M., et al.",Biotechnol Lett,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-006-9142-3,"DL-Alanine was produced from glucose in an Escherichia coli pfl pps poxB ldhA aceEF pTrc99A-alaD strain which lacked pyruvate-formate lyase, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) synthase, pyruvate oxidase, lactate dehydogenase, components of the pyruvate dehydogenase complex and over-produced alanine dehydrogenase (ALD). A two-phase process was developed with cell growth under aerobic conditions followed by alanine production under anaerobic conditions. Using the batch mode, cells grew to 5.3 g/l in 9 h with the accumulation of 6-10 g acetate/l, and under subsequent anaerobic conditions achieved 34 g alanine/l in 13 h with a yield of 0.86 g/g glucose. Using the fed-batch mode at micro = 0.15 h(-1), only about 1 g acetate/l formed in the 25 h required for the cells to reach 5.6 g/l, and 88 g alanine/l accumulated during the subsequent 23 h. This fed-batch process attained an alanine volumetric productivity of 4 g/lh during the production phase, and a yield that was essentially 1 g/g."
Microbial production of xylitol from L-arabinose by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Sakakibara, Y., et al.",J Biosci Bioeng,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2008.12.017,"An Escherichia coli strain, ZUC99(pATX210), which can produce xylitol from L-arabinose at a high yield, has been created by introducing a new bioconversion pathway into the cells. This pathway consists of three enzymes: L-arabinose isomerase (which converts L-arabinose to L-ribulose), D-psicose 3-epimerase (which converts L-ribulose to L-xylulose), and L-xylulose reductase (which converts L-xylulose to xylitol). The genes encoding these enzymes were cloned behind the araBAD promoter in tandem so that they were polycistronically transcribed from the single promoter, like an operon. Expression of the recombinant enzymes in the active form was successfully achieved in the presence of L-arabinose. A xylitol production profile of the recombinant strain was evaluated by shake-flask fermentation. ZUC99(pATX210) produced 2.6 g/l xylitol using 4.2 g/l L-arabinose with a xylitol yield of 0.62 g/g L-arabinose in 36 h. It was determined that utilization of glycerol as a co-substrate significantly improved xylitol production and yield. In the presence of 11.8 g/l glycerol, ZUC99(pATX210) produced 9.7 g/l xylitol from 10.5 g/l L-arabinose with a xylitol yield of 0.92 g/g L-arabinose in 36 h. ZUC99(pATX210) also exhibited efficient conversion in fermentor experiments with 1 l medium containing L-arabinose and glycerol. The strain produced 14.5 g/l xylitol from 15.2 g/l L-arabinose with a xylitol yield of 0.95 g/g L-arabinose in 30 h."
Engineering a colanic acid biosynthesis pathway in E. coli for manufacturing 2'-fucosyllactose,Q Chen,Process biochemistry,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2020.04.017,"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are beneficial for infantsâ health and growth. As one of the most abundant oligosaccharides in human milk, 2â²-fucosyllactose (2â²-FL) has been approved to supplement in infant formula. Microbial synthesis of 2â²-FL achieved in E. coli tends to use a T7-expression system for the heterologous expression of the fucosyltransferase and/or enzymes involved in fucose metabolism. In this paper, we report a novel bioconversion route of 2â²-FL by engineering a low pH triggered colanic acid (CA) synthetic pathway, found in E. coli S17â3, which supplies GDP-l-fucose for in vivo 2â²-FL formation catalyzed by the heterologous Î±-1,2-fucosyltransferases. In medium added with 10â¯g/L lactose and 20â¯g/L glycerol, recombinant S17â3 was able to produce 0.617â¯g/L of 2â²-FL. The concentration of 2â²-FL came to 1.029â¯g/L when a heterologous pathway for the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate was additionally introduced in the engineered S17â3."
Metabolic engineering of the L-phenylalanine pathway in Escherichia coli for the production of S-or R-mandelic acid,"Z Sun, Y Ning, L Liu, Y Liuâ¦",Microbial Cell Factories,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-10-71,"Background Mandelic acid (MA), an important component in pharmaceutical syntheses, is currently produced exclusively via petrochemical processes. Growing concerns over the environment and fossil energy costs have inspired a quest to develop alternative routes to MA using renewable resources. Herein we report the first direct route to optically pure MA from glucose via genetic modification of the L-phenylalanine pathway in E. coli. Results The introduction of hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from Amycolatopsis orientalis into E. coli led to a yield of 0.092 g/L S-MA. By combined deletion of competing pathways, further optimization of S-MA production was achieved, and the yield reached 0.74 g/L within 24 h. To produce R-MA, hydroxymandelate oxidase (Hmo) from Streptomyces coelicolor and D-mandelate dehydrogenase (DMD) from Rhodotorula graminis were co-expressed in an S-MA-producing strain, and the resulting strain was capable of producing 0.68 g/L R-MA. Finally, phenylpyruvate feeding experiments suggest that HmaS is a potential bottleneck to further improvement in yields. Conclusions We have constructed E. coli strains that successfully accomplished the production of S- and R-MA directly from glucose. Our work provides the first example of the completely fermentative production of S- and R-MA from renewable feedstock."

On this basic, the branch pathway genes were deleted, and the overexpression of the 2â²-FL efflux protein SetA and the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase GlpX were tuned. The resulting strain produced 46.06 ± 1.28 g/L 2â²-FL in a 5-L fermenter. Furtherly, adaptive laboratory evolution was conducted. A rpoC gene mutation was obtained which could improve the cell tolerance and the 2â²-FL production up to 61.06 ± 1.93 g/L, with the highest productivity of 1.70 g/L/h among E. coli strains by now. Taken together, this work provides a combinatorial strategy to improve 2â²-FL accumulation including rational fine-tuning pathway genes expressions and irrational adaptive laboratory evolution. This study should be helpful for constructing high level 2â²-FL producers."

Engineered Production of Short Chain Fatty Acid in Escherichia coli Using Fatty Acid Synthesis Pathway,"Jawed, K., et al.",PLoS One,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160035,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyric acid, have a broad range of applications in chemical and fuel industries. Worldwide demand of sustainable fuels and chemicals has encouraged researchers for microbial synthesis of SCFAs. In this study we compared three thioesterases, i.e., TesAT from Anaerococcus tetradius, TesBF from Bryantella formatexigens and TesBT from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, for production of SCFAs in Escherichia coli utilizing native fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway and modulated the genetic and bioprocess parameters to improve its yield and productivity. E. coli strain expressing tesBT gene yielded maximum butyric acid titer at 1.46 g L-1, followed by tesBF at 0.85 g L-1 and tesAT at 0.12 g L-1. The titer of butyric acid varied significantly depending upon the plasmid copy number and strain genotype. The modulation of genetic factors that are known to influence long chain fatty acid production, such as deletion of the fadD and fadE that initiates the fatty acid degradation cycle and overexpression of fadR that is a global transcriptional activator of fatty acid biosynthesis and repressor of degradation cycle, did not improve the butyric acid titer significantly. Use of chemical inhibitor cerulenin, which restricts the fatty acid elongation cycle, increased the butyric acid titer by 1.7-fold in case of TesBF, while it had adverse impact in case of TesBT. In vitro enzyme assay indicated that cerulenin also inhibited short chain specific thioesterase, though inhibitory concentration varied according to the type of thioesterase used. Further process optimization followed by fed-batch cultivation under phosphorous limited condition led to production of 14.3 g L-1 butyric acid and 17.5 g L-1 total free fatty acid at 28% of theoretical yield. This study expands our understanding of SCFAs production in E. coli through FASII pathway and highlights role of genetic and process optimization to enhance the desired product."
Reconstruction and optimization of a Pseudomonas putida-Escherichia coli microbial consortium for mcl-PHA production from lignocellulosic biomass,"Qin, R., et al.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2022.1023325,"The demand for non-petroleum-based, especially biodegradable plastics has been on the rise in the last decades. Medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) is a biopolymer composed of 6-14 carbon atoms produced from renewable feedstocks and has become the focus of research. In recent years, researchers aimed to overcome the disadvantages of single strains, and artificial microbial consortia have been developed into efficient platforms. In this work, we reconstructed the previously developed microbial consortium composed of engineered Pseudomonas putida KTâABZF (p2-a-J) and Escherichia coli â4D (ACP-SCLAC). The maximum titer of mcl-PHA reached 3.98 g/L using 10 g/L glucose, 5 g/L octanoic acid as substrates by the engineered P. putida KTâABZF (p2-a-J). On the other hand, the maximum synthesis capacity of the engineered E. coli â4D (ACP-SCLAC) was enhanced to 3.38 g/L acetic acid and 0.67 g/L free fatty acids (FFAs) using 10 g/L xylose as substrate. Based on the concept of nutrient supply-detoxification, the engineered E. coli â4D (ACP-SCLAC) provided nutrient for the engineered P. putida KTâABZF (p2-a-J) and it acted to detoxify the substrates. Through this functional division and rational design of the metabolic pathways, the engineered P. putida-E. coli microbial consortium could produce 1.30 g/L of mcl-PHA from 10 g/L glucose and xylose. Finally, the consortium produced 1.02 g/L of mcl-PHA using lignocellulosic hydrolysate containing 10.50 g/L glucose and 10.21 g/L xylose as the substrate.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBCs) were determined. The MIC of carvacrol against S. aureus was 3.2âg/l and of thymol was 7.5âg/l. E. coli was resistant. Carvacrol and thymol were bactericidal. The associations geraniol/menthol against S. aureus and B. cereus and thymol/menthol against B. cereus were totally synergistic. Eugenol/geraniol displayed partial synergism against B. cereus. The other groups did not show any synergistic effect. Eugenol had the lowest pKa, followed by thymol and carvacrol. Eugenol had the highest total area and polar area and intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding capacity, while carvacrol and thymol only had intermolecular hydrogen-bonding capacity. The terpenes alone and in combination were effective against microorganisms. Phenolic compounds were the most active terpenes. Associations between terpenes were related to the chemical structure. Studies on the antimicrobial activity of associations of terpenes will advance the search for new alternatives for food preservation. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

We constructed a range of mutant alleles of AroG, the enzyme involved in the first step of phenylalanine biosynthesis. Three single-site mutant alleles were constructed (aroG8, aroG15, and aroG29), which were then combined to generate three double-site aroG (fbr) mutant alleles (aroG8/15, aroG8/29, and aroG15/29). Enzymatic activity, feedback inhibition, and fermentation were analyzed in all of the mutants. All double-site mutants, except AroG15/29, showed higher enzymatic activity and greater resistance to feedback inhibition than their respective single-site mutants. The E. coli strain carrying the aroG8/15 allele produced a phenylalanine titer of 26.78 g/l, a 116 % improvement over the control phenylalanine overproducing strain (12.41 g/l). Our findings provide an effective method for modifying phenylalanine biosynthetic genes, which may be applied to optimize the commercial manufacture of phenylalanine."

Biosynthesis of geranate via isopentenol utilization pathway in Escherichia coli,"Pan, Q., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.28255,"Isoprenoids are a large family of natural products with diverse structures, which allow them to play diverse and important roles in the physiology of plants and animals. They also have important commercial uses as pharmaceuticals, flavoring agents, fragrances, and nutritional supplements. Recently, metabolic engineering has been intensively investigated and emerged as the technology of choice for the production of isoprenoids through microbial fermentation. Isoprenoid biosynthesis typically originates in plants from acetyl-coA in central carbon metabolism, however, a recent study reported an alternative pathway, the isopentenol utilization pathway (IUP), that can provide the building blocks of isoprenoid biosynthesis from affordable C5 substrates. In this study, we expressed the IUP in Escherichia coli to efficiently convert isopentenols into geranate, a valuable isoprenoid compound. We first established a geraniol-producing strain in E. coli that uses the IUP. Then, we extended the geraniol synthesis pathway to produce geranate through two oxidation reactions catalyzed by two alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases from Castellaniella defragrans. The geranate titer was further increased by optimizing the expression of the two dehydrogenases and also parameters of the fermentation process. The best strain produced 764 mg/L geranate in 24 h from 2 g/L isopentenols (a mixture of isoprenol and prenol). We also investigated if the dehydrogenases could accept other isoprenoid alcohols as substrates."
Exploring the combinatorial genomic space in Escherichia coli for ethanol tolerance,"Nicolaou, S. A., et al.",Biotechnol J,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201200227,"Strain tolerance to toxic chemicals is desirable for biologically producing biofuels and chemicals. Standard genomic libraries can be screened to identify genes imparting tolerance, but cannot capture interactions among proximal or distant loci. In search of ethanol tolerance determinants, we expanded the genomic space combinatorially by screening coexisting genomic libraries (CoGeLs) of fosmids (large inserts) and plasmids (smaller inserts) under increasing ethanol concentrations. Such screening led to identification of interacting genetic loci imparting ethanol tolerance. One pair of fragments ([galT, galE] and [recA, pncC, mltB]) increased survival under 50 g/L ethanol by 38% when coexpressed, but individually the fragments had no effect. Coexpression of two genomic fragments ([sfsB, murA, yrbA, mlaB, mlaC, mlaD, mlaE, mlaF, yrbG] and [yrbA, mlaB, mlaC]) enhanced Escherichia coli survival to 50 g/L ethanol by up to 115%. A 35-kb fosmid fragment increased tolerance to 63 g/L ethanol by 160%. While the tolerance levels of these strains compare favorably to or exceed the performance of previously reported engineered strains, more significantly, this study demonstrates that combinatorial library screening and screening fosmid libraries offer new, previously unexplored tools for identifying genetic determinants of ethanol, and by extrapolation, other alcohol tolerance."
Highâlevel production of dâpantothenic acid from glucose by fedâbatch cultivation of Escherichia coli,"SP Zou, ZJ Wang, K Zhao, B Zhangâ¦",Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bab.2044,"d-Pantothenic acid (D-PA) is an essential vitamin widely used in food, feed, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. An Escherichia coli platform was developed for the high-level production of D-PA from glucose through fed-batch cultivation. Initially, the effects of different glucose feeding strategies D-PA synthesis were studied. It was found that D-PA production in glucose control (5 g/L) fed-batch culture reached 24.3 g/L, which was 4.09 times that in the batch culture. Next, the effect of auxotrophic amino acid (isoleucine)-limited feeding on D-PA production was investigated. The results revealed that isoleucine feeding decreased the accumulation of by-product acetic acid and promoted D-PA production significantly. Furthermore, an isoleucine feeding embedded multistage glucose supply strategy was established, and a maximum titer of 39.1 g/L was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this levels are the highest reported so far in engineered E. coli for the D-PA production. The developed fed-batch feeding strategy may be useful for the industrial D-PA production by E. coli."

To accumulate L-serine, sdaA encoding the L-serine dehydratase, iclR encoding the isocitrate lyase regulator, and arcA encoding the aerobic respiration control protein were deleted in turn. In batch fermentation, the engineered E. coli strain YF-5 exhibited obvious L-serine accumulation but poor cell growth. To restore cell growth, aceB encoding the malate synthase was knocked out, and the engineered strain was then transformed with plasmid that overexpressed serAFR, serB, and serC genes. The resulting strain YF-7 produced 4.5 g/L L-serine in batch cultivation and 8.34 g/L L-serine in fed-batch cultivation."
Chemical Transformation of E. coli,WE Swords,E. coli Plasmid Vectors: Methods and Applications,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.1385/1-59259-409-3:49,"Transformation is defined as the transfer of genetic information into a recipient bacterium using naked DNA, without any requirement for contact with a donor bacterium. The ability to transform or accept exogenous DNA is generally referred to as competence, although the term has been so widely used in different systems that it is difficult to generate an all-inclusive definition for competence. Natural competence occurs in a defined subset of bacterial species that have the capacity to take up linear, and sometimes circular, DNA, usually dependent on a specific uptake system. As natural competence is restricted to a subset of bacteria, methods for the chemical induction of a competent state in otherwise nontransformable bacteria are an important tool in bacterial genetics. For these species, competence refers to the ability to take up and propagate plasmid DNA, usually with no sequence specificity for uptake."
Expression and production of recombinant scorpine as a potassium channel blocker protein in Escherichia coli,"Seyfi, R., et al.",Biotechnol Appl Biochem,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bab.1704,"Scorpine is a cationic protein from the venom of Pandinus imperator, belonging to potassium channel blocker family, which has been shown to have antibacterial, antiviral, and antiplasmodia activities. In the present study, a pET-44a vector containing scorpine synthetic gene with T7 Promoter (pET 44a-His6-Nus-His6-tev-scorpine) was transferred into Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami B (DE3) for soluble expression of the protein in the cytoplasm and its overproduction. After confirming recombinant scorpine peptide expression using SDS-PAGE and Western blot, augmentation of production was performed during two stages. At first, effects of three parameters including carbon source concentration of medium, temperature, and induction time were investigated in terrific broth (TB) medium. Afterward, the overexpression was performed by response surface methodology in TB + glucose. Under the optimized conditions, the highest production of 3.5 g/L in the TB + glucose medium (7.5 g/L glucose, induction at OD(600) = 3.5 and 25 degrees C) was increased to 4.1 g/L in TB medium (2.5 g/L glycerol, induction at OD(600) = 0.7 and 25 degrees C). Then, in order to increase the amount of protein production, effects of carbon concentration in the fermenter under the primary optimized condition was investigated. The amount of produced recombinant protein increased from 0.12 to 2.1 g/L.H. The results were similar to previous studies on optimizing and increasing the production of recombinant protein and in particular recombinant scorpine."
Engineering Escherichia coli for efficient production of 5-aminolevulinic acid from glucose,"Z Kang, Y Wang, Q Wang",Metabolic engineering,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2011.05.003,"5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) recently received much attention due to its potential applications in many fields. In this study, we developed a metabolic strategy to produce ALA directly from glucose in recombinant Escherichia coli via the C5 pathway. The expression of a mutated hemA gene, encoding a glutamyl-tRNA reductase from Salmonella arizona, significantly improved ALA production from 31.1 to 176 mg/L. Glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase from E. coli was found to have a synergistic effect with HemAM from S. arizona on ALA production (2052 mg/L). In addition, we identified a threonine/homoserine exporter in E. coli, encoded by rhtA gene, which exported ALA due to its broad substrate specificity. The constructed E. coli DALA produced 4.13 g/L ALA in modified minimal medium from glucose without adding any other co-substrate or inhibitor. This strategy offered an attractive potential to metabolic production of ALA in E. coli."
Light-powered Escherichia coli cell division for chemical production,"Ding, Q., et al.",Nat Commun,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16154-3,"Cell division can perturb the metabolic performance of industrial microbes. The C period of cell division starts from the initiation to the termination of DNA replication, whereas the D period is the bacterial division process. Here, we first shorten the C and D periods of E. coli by controlling the expression of the ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB and division proteins FtsZA through blue light and near-infrared light activation, respectively. It increases the specific surface area to 3.7 mum(-1) and acetoin titer to 67.2 g.L(-1). Next, we prolong the C and D periods of E. coli by regulating the expression of the ribonucleotide reductase NrdA and division protein inhibitor SulA through blue light activation-repression and near-infrared (NIR) light activation, respectively. It improves the cell volume to 52.6 mum(3) and poly(lactate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) titer to 14.31 g.L(-1). Thus, the optogenetic-based cell division regulation strategy can improve the efficiency of microbial cell factories."
Modification of aspartokinase III and dihydrodipicolinate synthetase increases the production of L-lysine in Escherichia coli,"J Xu, M Han, X Ren, W Zhang",Biochemical Engineering Journal,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2016.06.025,"To develop an l-lysine high-yielding strain, the enzymes involved in the l-lysine biosynthetic pathway, including aspartokinase III (AK III) and dihydrodipicolinate synthetase (DHDPS) were investigated. Allosteric enzymes involved in l-lysine production from l-lysine producer Escherichia coli LATR11 were sequenced and showed that AK III with mutation T344M or DHDPS with mutation H56K is more conducive to l-lysine production than AK III with mutation M318I or E250K-M318I-G323D or DHDPS with mutation H118Y. Moreover, an l-lysine high-yielding strain was developed from E. coli LATR11 via overexpression of ppc, lysCT344M, asd, dapAH56K, dapB, and lysA combined with heterologous expression of Corynebacterium glutamicum ddh.

High-flux isobutanol production using engineered Escherichia coli: a bioreactor study with in situ product removal,"Baez, A., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3173-y,"Promising approaches to produce higher alcohols, e.g., isobutanol, using Escherichia coli have been developed with successful results. Here, we translated the isobutanol process from shake flasks to a 1-L bioreactor in order to characterize three E. coli strains. With in situ isobutanol removal from the bioreactor using gas stripping, the engineered E. coli strain (JCL260) produced more than 50 g/L in 72 h. In addition, the isobutanol production by the parental strain (JCL16) and the high isobutanol-tolerant mutant (SA481) were compared with JCL260. Interestingly, we found that the isobutanol-tolerant strain in fact produced worse than either JCL16 or JCL260. This result suggests that in situ product removal can properly overcome isobutanol toxicity in E. coli cultures. The isobutanol productivity was approximately twofold and the titer was 9% higher than n-butanol produced by Clostridium in a similar integrated system."

This clay mineral significantly affected maximal growth rate and yield of the E. coli-strain (MG 1655) in minimum growth medium with 0.2% glucose, at an optimal concentration of 0.2 to 0.5 g/l. These physiological modifications were related to a decrease in catabolic activity and increased acetate assimilation via an energy transfer from acetate degradation to cell division rather than maintenance."
Enhancement of Human Î³-Interferon Production in Recombinant E. coli Using Batch Cultivation,"V Babaeipour, SA Shojaosadati, R Khalilzadeh",Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8718-5,"Development of inexpensive and simple culture media and appropriate induction conditions are always favorable for industry. In this research, chemical composition and stoichiometric data for Î³-interferon production and recombinant Escherichia coli growth were used in order to achieve a simple medium and favorable induction conditions. To achieve this goal, the effects of medium composition and induction conditions on the production of Î³-interferon were investigated in batch culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) [pET3a-ifnÎ³]. These conditions were considered as suitable conditions for the production of Î³-interferon: 2.5Ã M9 medium, supplemented with a mixture of amino acids (milligram per liter), including glutamic acid 215, aspartic acid 250, lysine 160, and phenylalanine 90, and induction at late-log phase (OD600â=â4.5).

Engineering Escherichia coli to increase plasmid DNA production in high cell-density cultivations in batch mode,"Borja, G. M., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-11-132,"BACKGROUND: Plasmid DNA (pDNA) is a promising molecule for therapeutic applications. pDNA is produced by Escherichia coli in high cell-density cultivations (HCDC) using fed-batch mode. The typical limitations of such cultivations, including metabolic deviations like aerobic acetate production due to the existence of substrate gradients in large-scale bioreactors, remain as serious challenges for fast and effective pDNA production. We have previously demonstrated that the substitution of the phosphotransferase system by the over-expressed galactose permease for glucose uptake in E. coli (strain VH33) allows efficient growth, while strongly decreases acetate production. In the present work, additional genetic modifications were made to VH33 to further improve pDNA production. Several genes were deleted from strain VH33: the recA, deoR, nupG and endA genes were inactivated independently and in combination. The performance of the mutant strains was evaluated in shake flasks for the production of a 6.1 kb plasmid bearing an antigen gene against mumps. The best producer strain was cultivated in lab-scale bioreactors using 100 g/L of glucose to achieve HCDC in batch mode. For comparison, the widely used commercial strain DH5alpha, carrying the same plasmid, was also cultivated under the same conditions. RESULTS: The various mutations tested had different effects on the specific growth rate, glucose uptake rate, and pDNA yields (YP/X). The triple mutant VH33 Delta (recA deoR nupG) accumulated low amounts of acetate and resulted in the best YP/X (4.22 mg/g), whereas YP/X of strain VH33 only reached 1.16 mg/g. When cultivated at high glucose concentrations, the triple mutant strain produced 186 mg/L of pDNA, 40 g/L of biomass and only 2.2 g/L of acetate. In contrast, DH5alpha produced only 70 mg/L of pDNA and accumulated 9.5 g/L of acetate. Furthermore, the supercoiled fraction of the pDNA produced by the triple mutant was nearly constant throughout the cultivation. CONCLUSION: The pDNA concentration obtained with the engineered strain VH33 Delta (recA deoR nupG) is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported for a batch cultivation, and its supercoiled fraction remained close to 80%. Strain VH33 Delta (recA deoR nupG) and its cultivation using elevated glucose concentrations represent an attractive technology for fast and efficient pDNA production and a valuable alternative to fed-batch cultivations of commercial strains."
Whole-cell conversion of l-glutamic acid into gamma-aminobutyric acid by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Ke, C., et al.",Springerplus,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2217-2,"A simple and high efficient way for the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was developed by using engineered Escherichia coli as whole-cell biocatalyst from l-glutamic acid (l-Glu).

While a number of organisms are capable of succinate production naturally, this review focuses on the engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. Important features of a succinate production system are to achieve an optimal balance of reducing equivalents generated by consumption of the feedstock, while maximizing the amount of carbon channeled into the product. Aerobic and anaerobic production strains have been developed and applied to production from glucose and other abundant carbon sources. Metabolic engineering methods and strain evolution have been used and supplemented by the recent application of systems biology and in silico modeling tools to construct optimal production strains. The metabolic capacity of the production strain, the requirement for efficient recovery of succinate, and the reliability of the performance under scaleup are important in the overall process. The costs of the overall biorefinery-compatible process will determine the economic commercialization of succinate and its impact in larger chemical markets."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of putrescine: A four carbon diamine,"ZG Qian, XX Xia, SY Lee",Biotechnology and bioengineering,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.22502,"A four carbon linear chain diamine, putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane), is an important platform chemical having a wide range of applications in chemical industry. Biotechnological production of putrescine from renewable feedstock is a promising alternative to the chemical synthesis that originates from non-renewable petroleum. Here we report development of a metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli that produces putrescine at high titer in glucose mineral salts medium. First, a base strain was constructed by inactivating the putrescine degradation and utilization pathways, and deleting the ornithine carbamoyltransferase chain I gene argI to make more precursors available for putrescine synthesis. Next, ornithine decarboxylase, which converts ornithine to putrescine, was amplified by a combination of plasmid-based and chromosome-based overexpression of the coding genes under the strong tac or trc promoter. Furthermore, the ornithine biosynthetic genes (argC-E) were overexpressed from the trc promoter, which replaced the native promoter in the genome, to increase the ornithine pool. Finally, strain performance was further improved by the deletion of the stress responsive RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoS, a well-known global transcription regulator that controls the expression of ca. 10% of the E. coli genes. The final engineered E. coli strain was able to produce 1.68âgâLâ1 of putrescine with a yield of 0.168âgâgâ1 glucose. Furthermore, high cell density cultivation allowed production of 24.2âgâLâ1 of putrescine with a productivity of 0.75âgâLâ1âhâ1. The strategy reported here should be useful for the bio-based production of putrescine from renewable resources, and also for the development of strains capable of producing other diamines, which are important as nitrogen-containing platform chemicals.

Efficient free fatty acid production in Escherichia coli using plant acyl-ACP thioesterases,"Zhang, X., et al.",Metab Eng,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2011.09.007,"Microbial biosynthesis of fatty acid-like chemicals from renewable carbon sources has attracted significant attention in recent years. Free fatty acids can be used as precursors for the production of fuels or chemicals. Free fatty acids can be produced by introducing an acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase gene into Escherichia coli. The presence of the acyl-ACP thioesterase will break the fatty acid elongation cycle and release free fatty acid. Depending on their sequence similarity and substrate specificity, class FatA thioesterase is active on unsaturated acyl-ACPs and class FatB prefers saturated acyl group. Different acyl-ACP thioesterases have different degrees of chain length specificity. Although some of these enzymes have been characterized from a number of sources, information on their ability to produce free fatty acid in microbial cells has not been extensively examined until recently. In this study, we examined the effect of the overexpression of acyl-ACP thioesterase genes from Diploknema butyracea, Gossypium hirsutum, Ricinus communis and Jatropha curcas on free fatty acid production. In particular, we are interested in studying the effect of different acyl-ACP thioesterase on the quantities and compositions of free fatty acid produced by an E. coli strain ML103 carrying these constructs. It is shown that the accumulation of free fatty acid depends on the acyl-ACP thioesterase used. The strain carrying the acyl-ACP thioesterase gene from D. butyracea produced approximately 0.2g/L of free fatty acid while the strains carrying the acyl-ACP thioesterase genes from R. communis and J. curcas produced the most free fatty acid at a high level of more than 2.0 g/L at 48 h. These two strains accumulated three major straight chain free fatty acids, C14, C16:1 and C16 at levels about 40%, 35% and 20%, respectively."

In this study, to enhance D-PA production, statistical optimization techniques including Plackett-Burman (PB) design and Box-Behnken design (BBD) first were adopted to optimize the culture condition. The results showed that the glucose, beta-alanine and (NH(4))(2)SO(4) have the most significant effects on D-PA biosynthesis. The response surface model based on BBD predicted that the optimal concentration is glucose 56.0 g/L, beta-alanine 2.25 g/L and (NH4)(2)SO(4) 11.8 g/L, the D-PA titer increases from 3.2 g/L to 6.73 g/L shake flask fermentation. For the fed-batch fermentation in 5 L fermenter, the isoleucine feeding strategy greatly increased the titer and productivity of D-PA. As a result, titer (31.6 g/L) and productivity (13.2 g/L.d) of D-PA were achieved, they increased by 4.66 times and 2.65 times, respectively, compared with batch culture. At the same time, the accumulation of acetate reduced from 29.79 g/L to 8.55 g/L in the fed-batch fermentation. These results demonstrated that the optimization of medium composition and the cell growth rate are important to increase the concentration of D-PA for microbial fermentation.

Metabolic engineering was applied to generate Escherichia coli strains for the production of L-DOPA from glucose by modifying the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) and aromatic biosynthetic pathways. Carbon flow was directed to the biosynthesis of L-tyrosine (L-Tyr), an L-DOPA precursor, by transforming strains with compatible plasmids carrying genes encoding a feedback-inhibition resistant version of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, transketolase, the chorismate mutase domain from chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase from E. coli and cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis. The effects on L-Tyr production of PTS inactivation (PTSâ gluc+ phenotype), as well as inactivation of the regulatory protein TyrR, were evaluated. PTS inactivation caused a threefold increase in the specific rate of L-Tyr production (qL-Tyr), whereas inactivation of TyrR caused 1.7- and 1.9-fold increases in qL-Tyr in the PTS+ and the PTSâ gluc+ strains, respectively. An 8.6-fold increase in L-Tyr yield from glucose was observed in the PTSâ gluc+  tyrR  â strain.

Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cassava to succinic acid by Escherichia coli NZN111,"Chen, C., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.04.020,"In this study, the production of succinic acid from cassava starch and raw cassava instead of glucose by Escherichia coli NZN111 was investigated. During the two-stage fermentation, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) was applied in the anaerobic stage. The results showed that both the productivity and specific productivity in the process conducted at 40 degrees C were higher than those in the cultivation conducted at 37 degrees C. The yield of succinic acid based on the amount of added starch reached the highest level 0.86 g/g and cassava starch was almost totally hydrolyzed in the SSF process. With the improved cell density, 127.13 g/L of succinic acid was obtained. When the liquefied crude cassava powder was used directly in SSF, 106.17 g/L of succinic acid was formed. The result showed that crude cassava powder could be another cheap raw material for succinic acid formation."
Development of Genetically Stable Escherichia coli Strains for Poly(3-Hydroxypropionate) Production,Y Gao,PLoS One,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097845,"Poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) is a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic. In our previous study, a pathway for P3HP production was constructed in recombinant Esecherichia coli. Seven exogenous genes in P3HP synthesis pathway were carried by two plasmid vectors. However, the P3HP production was severely suppressed by strain instability due to plasmid loss. In this paper, two strategies, chromosomal gene integration and plasmid addiction system (PAS) based on amino acid anabolism, were applied to construct a genetically stable strain. Finally, a combination of those two methods resulted in the best results. The resultant strain carried a portion of P3HP synthesis genes on chromosome and the others on plasmid, and also brought a tyrosine-auxotrophy based PAS. In aerobic fed-batch fermentation, this strain produced 25.7 g/L P3HP from glycerol, about 2.5-time higher than the previous strain with two plasmids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest P3HP production from inexpensive carbon sources."
Muconic Acid Production Using Gene-Level Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli,"Fujiwara, R., et al.",ACS Synth Biol,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00380,"This study reports on the improving of muconic acid (MA) production by using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. Three MA synthesis pathways separately were introduced into E. coli. After 72 h of cultivation, two of the three strains, i.e., one carrying the Pathway 1 (1.00 g/L) and the other carrying the Pathway 3 (1.34 g/L) produced MA. To increase MA production, the enzymes of the shikimate pathway (AroC and AroD) were overexpressed in these strains. Although the overexpression of AroC increased the MA production (1.59 g/L) by the Pathway 1, AroD overexpression decreased it by the Pathway 3. The metabolic channeling using gene-level fusion proteins additionally increased the MA production. In the pathway 1 and pH-controlled cultures, the overexpression of a fusion protein (AroC and MenF) increased the MA production from 20 g/L glucose to >3 and 4.45 g/L, respectively. These results suggest that the metabolic channeling approach is a promising strategy to increase the yield of the target compound."
Strategy for pH control and pH feedback-controlled substrate feeding for high-level production of l-tryptophan by Escherichia coli,"LK Cheng, J Wang, QY Xu, CG Zhao, ZQ Shenâ¦",World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11274-012-1243-7,"Optimum production of L-tryptophan by Escherichia coli depends on pH. Here, we established conditions for optimizing the production of L-tryptophan. The optimum pH range was 6.5â7.2, and pH was controlled using a three-stage strategy [pH 6.5 (0â12 h), pH 6.8 (12â24 h), and pH 7.2 (24â38 h)]. Specifically, ammonium hydroxide was used to adjust pH during the initial 24 h, and potassium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide (1:2, v/v) were used to adjust pH during 24â38 h. Under these conditions, NH4 + and K+ concentrations were kept below the threshold for inhibiting L-tryptophan production. Optimization was also accomplished using ratios (v/v) of glucose to alkali solutions equal to 4:1 (5â24 h) and 6:1 (24â38 h). The concentration of glucose and the pH were controlled by adjusting the pH automatically. Applying a pH-feedback feeding method, the steady-state concentration of glucose was maintained at approximately 0.2 ± 0.02 g/l, and acetic acid accumulated to a concentration of 1.15 ± 0.03 g/l, and the plasmid stability was 98 ± 0.5 %.

Improvement of isopropanol production by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli using gas stripping,"Inokuma, K., et al.",J Biosci Bioeng,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.07.010,"To improve isopropanol production by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain TA76, the optimization of fermentation conditions and isopropanol removal by gas stripping were performed. Isopropanol is one of the simplest secondary alcohols, and it can be dehydrated to yield propylene, which is currently derived from petroleum as a monomer for making polypropylene. Initially, using a pH-controlled fed-batch culture with the intermittent addition of glucose, strain TA76 produced 667 mM (40.1g/L) of isopropanol after 60 h, representing 73.2% (mol isopropanol/mol glucose) of the theoretical maximum yield. Because the accumulation of isopropanol drastically reduced production yields, a gas stripping recovery method was incorporated into the fed-batch culture system. Using this approach, strain TA76 produced 2378 mM (143 g/L) of isopropanol after 240 h with a yield of 67.4% (mol/mol). To our knowledge, this titer represents the highest level of isopropanol production by E. coli to date and suggests that strain TA76 has a great potential for commercial fermentative isopropanol production."

Adsorbed Polymer and NOM Limits Adhesion and Toxicity of Nano Scale Zerovalent Iron to E. coli,"PJJ Alvarez, KB Gregory",Environmental Science & Technology,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/es9031198,"Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) is used for groundwater remediation. Freshly synthesized bare, i.e. uncoated NZVI is bactericidal at low mg/L concentration, but the impact of surface modifiers and aging (partial oxidation) on its bactericidal properties have not been determined. Here we assess the effect that adsorbed synthetic polymers and natural organic matter (NOM) and aging (partial oxidation) have on the bactericidal properties of NZVI to the gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli. Exposure to 100 mg/L of bare NZVI with 28% Fe0 content resulted in a 2.2-log inactivation after 10 min and a 5.2-log inactivation after 60 min. Adsorbed poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), poly(aspartate) (PAP), or NOM on NZVI with the same Fe0 content significantly decreased its toxicity, causing less than 0.2-log inactivation after 60 min. TEM images and heteroaggregation studies indicate that bare NZVI adheres significantly to cells and that the adsorbed polyelectrolyte or NOM prevents adhesion, thereby decreasing NZVI toxicity. The 1.8-log inactivation observed for bare NZVI with 7% Fe0 content was lower than the 5.2-log inactivation using NZVI with 28% Fe0 after 1 h; however, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) after 24 h was 5 mg/L regardless of Fe0 content. The MIC of PSS, PAP, and NOM coated NZVI were much higher: 500 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 100 mg/L, respectively. But the MIC was much lower than the typical injection concentration used in remediation (10 g/L). Complete oxidation of Fe0 in NZVI under aerobic conditions eliminated its bactericidal effects. This study indicates that polyelectrolyte coatings and NOM will mitigate the toxicity of NZVI for exposure concentrations below 0.1 to 0.5 g/L depending on the coating and that aged NZVI without Fe0 is relatively benign to bacteria."
Overcoming glutamate auxotrophy in Escherichia coli itaconate overproducer by the Weimberg pathway,"Lu, K. W., et al.",Metab Eng Commun,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mec.2021.e00190,"Biosynthesis of itaconic acid occurs through decarboxylation of the TCA cycle intermediate cis-aconitate. Engineering of efficient itaconate producers often requires elimination of the highly active isocitrate dehydrogenase to conserve cis-aconitate, leading to 2-ketoglutarate auxotrophy in the producing strains. Supplementation of glutamate or complex protein hydrolysate then becomes necessary, often in large quantities, to support the high cell density desired during itaconate fermentation and adds to the production cost. Here, we present an alternative approach to overcome the glutamate auxotrophy in itaconate producers by synthetically introducing the Weimberg pathway from Burkholderia xenovorans for 2-ketoglutarate biosynthesis. Because of its independence from natural carbohydrate assimilation pathways in Escherichia coli, the Weimberg pathway is able to provide 2-ketoglutarate using xylose without compromising the carbon flux toward itaconate. With xylose concentration carefully tuned to minimize excess 2-ketoglutarate flux in the stationary phase, the final strain accumulated 20 g/L of itaconate in minimal medium from 18 g/L of xylose and 45 g/L of glycerol. Necessity of the recombinant Weimberg pathway for growth also allowed us to maintain multi-copy plasmids carrying in operon the itaconate-producing genes without addition of antibiotics. Use of the Weimberg pathway for growth restoration is applicable to other production systems with disrupted 2-ketoglutarate synthesis."

However, the sophisticated biochemical network and metabolic burden within microbial hosts always compromise the pathway performance and product yields of desired chemicals, inevitably limiting their translation into industrial bioprocesses. In this work, using the mevalonate-based isoprenol pathway as a proof-of-principle demonstration, we applied the CRISPR/dCas9 interference (CRISPRi) screening to identify endogenous gene targets intervening or promoting isoprenol biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. via CRISPRi screening in an engineered mevalonate-overproducing E. coli strain, we identified genes involved in the phosphate intermediate hydrolysis (aphA, yieH and yggV), carbon flux redirection (accA), and isoprenol tolerance (astE) pathways, whose over-expression or repression enabled 68.2%, 28.8%, and 62.1% increase of isoprenol titers, respectively. The combinatorial repression of yggV and accA permitted the highest isoprenol titer of 3.63 g Lâ1 in shake flask based batch cultivation, with the yield reaching 57% of the theoretical maximal pathway yield. Further shake flask based fed-batch cultivation increased the isoprenol titer to 8.51 g Lâ1, during which the isoprenol yield within the stationary growth phase could reach 85% of the theoretical maximal pathway yield. This work demonstrated the application of CRISPRi screening in the systematic optimization of the synthetic pathway performance in microbial hosts and enabled high-yield isoprenol production in metabolically engineered E. coli."
Laboratory metabolic evolution improves acetate tolerance and growth on acetate of ethanologenic Escherichia coli under non-aerated conditions in glucose-mineral â¦,"MT FernÃ¡ndez-Sandoval, G Huerta-Beristain",Applied microbiology and Biotechnology,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4177-y,"In this work, Escherichia coli MG1655 was engineered to produce ethanol and evolved in a laboratory process to obtain an acetate tolerant strain called MS04 (E. coli MG1655: ÎpflB, ÎadhE, ÎfrdA, ÎxylFGH, ÎldhA, PpflB::pdc Zm -adhB Zm , evolved). The growth and ethanol production kinetics of strain MS04 were determined in mineral medium, mainly under non-aerated conditions, supplemented with glucose in the presence of different concentrations of sodium acetate at pH 7.0 and at different values of acid pH and a constant concentration of sodium acetate (2 g/l). Results revealed an increase in the specific growth rate, cell mass formation, and ethanol volumetric productivity at moderate concentrations of sodium acetate (2â10 g/l), in addition to a high tolerance to acetate because it was able to grow and produce a high yield of ethanol in the presence of up to 40 g/l of sodium acetate. Genomic analysis of the ÎpflB evolved strain identified that a chromosomal deletion of 27.3 kb generates the improved growth and acetate tolerance in MG1655 ÎpflB derivative strains. This deletion comprises genes related to the respiration of nitrate, repair of alkylated DNA and synthesis of the ompC gene coding for porin C, cytochromes C, thiamine, and colonic acid. Strain MS04 is advantageous for the production of ethanol from hemicellulosic hydrolysates that contain acetate."
High-level production of L-valine in Escherichia coli using multi-modular engineering,"Hao, Y., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.127461,"L-valine is a valuable amino acid in mammals that is used as the main component of feed additives. The low efficiency of the fermentation titer limits the industrial application of L-valine. Here, an L-valine-producing strain of Escherichia coli was obtained using a multi-modular strategy. Initially, a chassis strain was generated by mutagenesis and high-throughput screening. The L-valine biosynthetic pathway and transport module were modified to improve the L-valine titer. Subsequently, the transcription factors associated with L-valine biosynthesis were investigated. Overexpression of PdhR and inhibition of the expression of RpoS promoted L-valine synthesis. Finally, the NADPH supply was enhanced after the introduction of the heterologous Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway from Zymomonas mobilis. The strain VAL38 produced 92 g/L L-valine in a 5-L bioreactor with a yield of 0.34 g/g glucose. This strategy is provided as a reference for improving the production performance of cell factories for L-valine and its derivatives."
Efficient Production of 2â²-Fucosyllactose from l-Fucose via Self-Assembling Multienzyme Complexes in Engineered Escherichia coli,W Zhang,ACS Synthetic Biology,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.1c00102,"2â²-Fucosyllactose (2â²-FL) has been widely used as a nutritional additive in infant formula due to its multifarious nutraceutical and pharmaceutical functions in neonate health. As such, it is essential to develop an efficient and extensive microbial fermentation platform to cater to the needs of the 2â²-FL market. In this study, a spatial synthetic biology strategy was employed to promote 2â²-FL biosynthesis in recombinant Escherichia coli. First, the salvage pathway for 2â²-FL production from l-fucose and lactose was constructed by introducing a bifunctional enzyme l-fucokinase/GDP-l-fucose pyrophosphorylase (Fkp) derived from Bacteroides fragilis and an Î±-1,2-fucosyltransferase (FutC) derived from Helicobacter pylori into engineered E. coli BL21(DE3). Next, the endogenous genes involved in the degradation and shunting of the substrate and key intermediate were inactivated to improve the availability of precursors for 2â²-FL biosynthesis. Moreover, to further improve the yield and titer of 2â²-FL, a short peptide pair (RIAD-RIDD) was used to form self-assembling multienzyme complexes in vivo. The spatial localization of peptides and stoichiometry of enzyme assemblies were subsequently optimized to further improve 2â²-FL production. Finally, cofactor regeneration was also considered to alleviate the potential cofactor deficiency and redox flux imbalance in the biocatalysis process. Fed-batch fermentation of the final WLS20 strain accumulated 30.5 g/L extracellular 2â²-FL with the yield and productivity of 0.661 mol/mol fucose and 0.48 g/L/h, respectively. This research has demonstrated that the application of spatial synthetic biology and metabolic engineering strategies can dramatically enlarge the titer and yield of 2â²-FL biosynthesis in engineered E. coli."
Flux redistribution of central carbon metabolism for efficient production of lâtryptophan in Escherichia coli,"B Xiong, Y Zhu, D Tian, S Jiang, X Fanâ¦",Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27665,"Microbial production of l-tryptophan (l-trp) has received considerable attention because of its diverse applications in food additives and pharmaceuticals. Overexpression of rate-limiting enzymes and blockage of competing pathways can effectively promote microbial production of l-trp. However, the biosynthetic process remains suboptimal due to imbalanced flux distribution between central carbon and tryptophan metabolism, presenting a major challenge to further improvement of l-trp yield. In this study, we redistributed central carbon metabolism to improve phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) pools in an l-trp producing strain of Escherichia coli for efficient l-trp synthesis. To do this, a phosphoketolase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis was introduced to strengthen E4P formation, and the l-trp titer and yield increased to 10.8âg/L and 0.148âg/gâglucose, respectively. Next, the phosphotransferase system was substituted with PEP-independent glucose transport, meditated by a glucose facilitator from Zymomonas mobilis and native glucokinase. This modification improved l-trp yield to 0.164âg/g glucose, concomitant with 58% and 40% decreases of acetate and lactate accumulation, respectively. Then, to channel more central carbon flux to the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, several metabolic engineering strategies were applied to rewire the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node. Finally, the constructed strain SX11 produced 41.7âg/L l-trp with an overall yield of 0.227âg/g glucose after 40âh fed-batch fermentation in 5-L bioreactor. This is the highest overall yield of l-trp ever reported from a rationally engineered strain. Our results suggest the flux redistribution of central carbon metabolism to maintain sufficient supply of PEP and E4P is a promising strategy for efficient l-trp biosynthesis, and this strategy would likely also increase the production of other aromatic amino acids and derivatives."
Production of L-phenylalanine from glucose by metabolic engineering of wild type Escherichia coli W3110,"SP Liu, MR Xiao, L Zhang, J Xu, ZY Ding, ZH Guâ¦",Process biochemistry,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2013.02.016,"The market of l-phenylalanine has been stimulated by the great demand for the low-calorie sweetener aspartame. In this paper, the effects of pivotal genes on l-phenylalanine production were evaluated by metabolic engineering of wild type Escherichia coli. The bifunctional PheA protein contains two catalytic domains (chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase activities) as well as one R-domain (for feedback inhibition by l-phenylalanine). The catalytic domain of PheA was overexpressed to increase l-phenylalanine production. It was firstly indicated that this domain could enhance the metabolic influx to overproduce l-phenylalanine and improve the survival ability under m-Fluoro-dl-phenylalanine stress. Furthermore, the fermentation performance of aroG feedback inhibition resistant mutants was firstly compared, aroG29 and aroG15 increased the l-phenylalanine concentration by 5-fold. After that the expression of aroK and ydiB was also elevated, and the l-phenylalanine yield on cell (0.79 g/g) and maximum l-phenylalanine productivity (0.073 g/L/h) were subsequently doubled. Meanwhile, the l-phenylalanine yield on glucose increased from 0.124 g/g to 0.153 g/g. It was found that genes ydiB and aroK could elevate the l-phenylalanine yield and productivity and shorten the lag phase."
Enhancement of D-lactic acid production from a mixed glucose and xylose substrate by the Escherichia coli strain JH15 devoid of the glucose effect,"Lu, H., et al.",BMC Biotechnol,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-016-0248-y,"BACKGROUND: A thermal tolerant stereo-complex poly-lactic acid (SC-PLA) can be made by mixing Poly-D-lactic acid (PDLA) and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) at a defined ratio. This environmentally friendly biodegradable polymer could replace traditional recalcitrant petroleum-based plastics. To achieve this goal, however, it is imperative to produce optically pure lactic acid isomers using a cost-effective substrate such as cellulosic biomass. The roadblock of this process is that: 1) xylose derived from cellulosic biomass is un-fermentable by most lactic acid bacteria 2) the glucose effect results in delayed and incomplete xylose fermentation. An alternative strain devoid of the glucose effect is needed to co-utilize both glucose and xylose for improved D-lactic acid production using a cellulosic biomass substrate. RESULTS: A previously engineered L-lactic acid Escherichia coli strain, WL204 (DeltafrdBC DeltaldhA DeltaackA DeltapflB DeltapdhR ::pflBp6-acEF-lpd DeltamgsA DeltaadhE, DeltaldhA::ldhL), was reengineered for production of D-lactic acid, by replacing the recombinant L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) with a D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA). The glucose effect (catabolite repression) of the resulting strain, JH13, was eliminated by deletion of the ptsG gene which encodes for IIBC(glc) (a PTS enzyme for glucose transport). The derived strain, JH14, was metabolically evolved through serial transfers in screw-cap tubes containing glucose. The evolved strain, JH15, regained improved anaerobic cell growth using glucose. In fermentations using a mixture of glucose (50 g L(-1)) and xylose (50 g L(-1)), JH15 co-utilized both glucose and xylose, achieving an average sugar consumption rate of 1.04 g L(-1)h(-1), a D-lactic acid titer of 83 g L(-1), and a productivity of 0.86 g L(-1) h(-1). This result represents a 46 % improved sugar consumption rate, a 26 % increased D-lactic acid titer, and a 48 % enhanced productivity, compared to that achieved by JH13. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that JH15 has the potential for fermentative production of D-lactic acid using cellulosic biomass derived substrates, which contain a mixture of C6 and C5 sugars."
Genetic engineering of Escherichia coli for the economical production of sialylated oligosaccharides,"Fierfort, N. and E. Samain",J Biotechnol,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2008.02.010,"We have previously described a microbiological process for the conversion of lactose into 3'sialyllactose and other ganglioside sugars by living Escherichia coli cells expressing the appropriate recombinant glycosyltransferase genes. In this system the activated sialic acid donor (CMP-Neu5Ac) was generated from exogenous sialic acid, which was transported into the cells by the permease NanT. Since sialic acid is an expensive compound, a more economical process has now been developed by genetically engineering E. coli K12 to be capable of generating CMP-Neu5Ac using its own internal metabolism. Mutant strains devoid of Neu5Ac aldolase and of ManNAc kinase were shown to efficiently produce 3'sialyllactose by coexpressing the alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase gene from Neisseria meningitidis with the neuC, neuB and neuACampylobacter jejuni genes encoding N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate-epimerase, sialic acid synthase and CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase, respectively. A sialyllactose concentration of 25 g l(-1) was obtained in long-term high cell density culture with a continuous lactose feed. This high concentration and low cost of fermentation medium should make possible to use sialylated oligosaccharides in new fields such as the food industry."

However, the industrial application was severely constrained due to low production. To obtain the Escherichia coli mutant producing l-tyrosine in abundance, the heat-inducible expression vector carrying the two feedback resistance enzymes (3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase encoded by aroGfbr and chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase encoded by tyrAfbr) were introduced into the phenylalanine-producing E. coli strain to enable it to synthesize l-tyrosine directly from glucose. Furthermore, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology was applied to eliminate l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan pathways for their competition for the carbon flux. The global regulatory protein TyrR, which mediates the biosynthesis and transportation of aromatic amino acids, was also deleted to increase l-tyrosine production. Among the recombinant strains, the pheA/tyrR double-gene deletion strain had the highest yield of 5.84 g/L on shake flasks. The feeding strategies were then optimized in a 3-L fermentor. The pheA/tyrR double-gene deletion strain with the heat-inducible expression plasmid pAP-aroGfbr-tyrAfbr was able to produce 55.54 g/L l-tyrosine by fed-batch fermentation; the substrate conversion rate was 0.25 g/g.

In this study, a novel growth-coupled erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) formation strategy that can be used to produce high levels of Î²-arbutin using engineered Escherichia coli and glycerol as the carbon source was developed. In the strategy, E4P formation was coupled with cell growth, and a growth-driving force made the E4P formation efficient. By applying this strategy, efficient microbial synthesis of Î²-arbutin was achieved, with 7.91 g/L Î²-arbutin produced in shaking flask, and 28.1 g/L produced in a fed batch fermentation with a yield of 0.20 g/g glycerol and a productivity of 0.39 g/L/h. This is the highest Î²-arbutin production through microbial fermentation ever reported to date. This study may have significant implications in the large-scale production of Î²-arbutin as well as other aromatic compounds of importance."

After optimizing the expression plasmid, 2.1 g/L ectoine was achieved. Besides, the aspartate kinase mutant LysC(T311I) from Corynebacterium glutamicum and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Halomonas elongata were overexpressed to increase precursors supply. Furthermore, the rate-limiting enzyme EctB was semirationally engineered, and the E407D mutation enhanced ectoine production by 13.8 %. To improve acetyl-CoA supply, the non-oxidative glycolysis pathway was introduced.

Fermentations were carried out at 37°C, pH 7.4, using a defined medium in a stirred tank bioreactor at various intensities of impeller agitation speeds (300â500 rpm corresponding to 0.97â1.62 m sâ1 impeller tip speed) and aeration rates (2â8 L minâ1, or 1â4 vvm). This highly aerobic fermentation required a good supply of oxygen, but intense agitation (impeller tip speed ~1.62 m sâ1) reduced the biomass and L-phenylalanine productivity, possibly because of shear sensitivity of the recombinant bacterium. Production of L-phenylalanine was apparently strongly associated with growth. Under the best operating conditions (1.30 m sâ1 impeller tip speed, 4 vvm aeration rate), the yield of L-phenylalanine on glycerol was 0.58 g gâ1, or more than twice the best yield attainable on sucrose (0.25 g gâ1). In the best case, the peak concentration of L-phenylalanine was 5.6 g Lâ1, or comparable to values attained in batch fermentations that use glucose or sucrose. The use of glycerol for the commercial production of L-phenylalanine with E. coli BL21(DE3) has the potential to substantially reduce the cost of production compared to sucrose- and glucose-based fermentations."
Metabolic Engineering of Escherichia coli for Increased Bioproduction of N-Acetylneuraminic Acid,"Liu, C., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c05994,"N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, it is important to develop an efficient and eco-friendly method for NeuAc production. Here, we achieved de novo biosynthesis of NeuAc in an engineered plasmid-free Escherichia coli strain, which efficiently synthesizes NeuAc using glycerol as the sole carbon source, via clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9-based genome editing. NeuAc key precursor, N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc 0.40 g/L), was produced by expressing UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase and glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlmS) mutants and blocking the NeuAc catabolic pathway in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The expression levels of GlmM and GlmU-GlmS(A) metabolic modules were optimized, significantly increasing the ManNAc titer to 8.95 g/L. Next, the expression levels of NeuAc synthase from different microorganisms were optimized, leading to the production of 6.27 g/L of NeuAc. Blocking the competing pathway of NeuAc biosynthesis increased the NeuAc titer to 9.65 g/L. In fed-batch culture in a 3 L fermenter, NeuAc titer reached 23.46 g/L with productivity of 0.69 g/L/h, which is the highest level achieved by microbial synthesis using glycerol as the sole carbon source in E. coli. The strategies used in our study can aid in the efficient bioproduction of NeuAc and its derivatives."
Systematic Engineering of Escherichia coli for Efficient Production of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide From Nicotinamide,"Huang, Z., et al.",ACS Synth Biol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00100,"Research studies on NAD(+) have proven its crucial role in aging and disease. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), as the key intermediate of NAD(+), plays a significant role in supplying and maintaining NAD(+) levels. In the present study, a biocatalytic method for the efficient synthesis of NMN was established. First, Escherichia coli was systematically modified to make it more conducive to the biosynthesis and accumulation of NMN. Next, the performance of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase from Vibrio bacteriophage KVP40 (VpNadV) was determined, which has the best catalytic activity to produce NMN from nicotinamide. The accumulation of extracellular NMN was further increased after the introduction of an NMN transporter. Fine-tuning of gene expression and copy number led to the synthesis of NMN at the yield of 2.6 g/L at the shake flask level. The introduction of a nicotinamide transporter, BcniaP, could not obviously increase the production of NMN at the shake flask level, but it decreased the production of NMN at the bioreactor level. Finally, the titer of NMN reached 16.2 g/L with a conversion ratio of 97.0% from nicotinamide, both of which are highest according to currently available reports. The fed-batch fermentation with direct supplementation of nicotinamide could facilitate the industrial-scale production of NMN compared to that achieved by the whole-cell catalysis process. These results also represent the highest reported yield of NMN synthesized from nicotinamide in E. coli."

S., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2001.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.7000195,"Recombinant Escherichia coli have been constructed for the conversion of glucose as well as pentose sugars into L-lactic acid. The strains carry the lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus bovis on a low copy number plasmid for production of L-lactate. Three E. coli strains were transformed with the plasmid for producing L-lactic acid. Strains FBR9 and FBR11 were serially transferred 10 times in anaerobic cultures in sugar-limited medium containing glucose or xylose without selective antibiotic. An average of 96% of both FBR9 and FBR11 cells maintained pVALDH1 in anaerobic cultures. The fermentation performances of FBR9, FBR10, and FBR11 were compared in pH-controlled batch fermentations with medium containing 10% w/v glucose. Fermentation results were superior for FBR11, an E. coli B strain, compared to those observed for FBR9 or FBR10. FBR11 exhausted the glucose within 30 h, and the maximum lactic acid concentration (7.32% w/v) was 93% of the theoretical maximum. The other side-products detected were cell mass and succinic acid (0.5 g/l)."
Construction of allitol synthesis pathway by multi-enzyme coexpression in Escherichia coli and its application in allitol production,"Zhu, Y., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-014-1578-1,"An engineered strain for the conversion of D-fructose to allitol was developed by constructing a multi-enzyme coupling pathway and cofactor recycling system in Escherichia coli. D-Psicose-3-epimerase from Ruminococcus sp. and ribitol dehydrogenase from Klebsiella oxytoca were coexpressed to form the multi-enzyme coupling pathway for allitol production. The cofactor recycling system was constructed using the formate dehydrogenase gene from Candida methylica for continuous NADH supply. The recombinant strain produced 10.62 g/l allitol from 100 mM D-fructose. To increase the intracellular concentration of the substrate, the glucose/fructose facilitator gene from Zymomonas mobilis was incorporated into the engineered strain. The results showed that the allitol yield was enhanced significantly to 16.53 g/l with a conversion rate of 92 %. Through optimizing conversion conditions, allitol was produced effectively on a large scale by the whole-cell biotransformation system the yield reached 48.62 g/l when 500 mM D-fructose was used as the substrate."
From scratch to value: engineering Escherichia coli wild type cells to the production of l-phenylalanine and other fine chemicals derived from chorismate,GA Sprenger,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-0931-y,"Recombinant strains of Escherichia coli K-12 for the production of the three aromatic amino acids (L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine) have been constructed. The largest demand is for L-phenylalanine (L-Phe), as it can be used as a building block for the low-calorie sweetener, aspartame. Besides L-Phe, an increasing number of shikimic acid pathway intermediates can be produced from appropriate E. coli mutants with blocks in this pathway. The last common intermediate, chorismate, in E. coli not only serves for production of aromatic amino acids but can also be used for high-titer production of non-aromatic compounds, e.g., cyclohexadiene-transdiols. In an approach to diversity-oriented metabolic engineering (metabolic grafting), platform strains with increased flux through the general aromatic pathway were created by suitable gene deletions, additions, or rearrangements. Examples for rational strain constructions for L-phenylalanine and chorismate derivatives are given with emphasis on genetic engineering. As a result, L-phenylalanine producers are available, which were derived through several defined steps from E. coli K-12 wild type. These mutant strains showed L-phenylalanine titers of up to 38 g/l of L-phenylalanine (and up to 45.5 g/l using in situ product recovery). Likewise, two cyclohexadiene-transdiols could be recovered."
Efficient whole-cell catalysis for 5-aminovalerate production from L-lysine by using engineered Escherichia coli with ethanol pretreatment,"Cheng, J., et al.",Sci Rep,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57752-x,"Microorganisms can utilize biomass to produce valuable chemicals, showing sustainable, renewable and economic advantages compared with traditional chemical synthesis. As a potential five-carbon platform polymer monomer, 5-aminovalerate has been widely used in industrial fields such as clothes and disposable goods. Here we establish an efficient whole-cell catalysis for 5-aminovalerate production with ethanol pretreatment. In this study, the metabolic pathway from L-lysine to 5-aminovalerate was constructed at the cellular level by introducing L-lysine alpha-oxidase. The newly produced H(2)O(2) and added ethanol both are toxic to the cells, obviously inhibiting their growth. Here, a promising strategy of whole-cell catalysis with ethanol pretreatment is proposed, which greatly improves the yield of 5-aminovalerate. Subsequently, the effects of ethanol pretreatment, substrate concentration, reaction temperature, pH value, metal ion additions and hydrogen peroxide addition on the whole-cell biocatalytic efficiency were investigated. Using 100 g/L of L-lysine hydrochloride as raw material, 50.62 g/L of 5-aminovalerate could be excellently produced via fed-batch bioconversion with the yield of 0.84 mol/mol. The results show that a fast, environmentally friendly and efficient production of 5-aminovalerate was established after introducing the engineered whole-cell biocatalysts. This strategy, combined with ethanol pretreatment, can not only greatly enhance the yield of 5-aminovalerate but also be applied to the biosynthesis of other valuable chemicals."
De Novo Biosynthesis of Glutarate via Î±-Keto Acid Carbon Chain Extension and Decarboxylation Pathway in Escherichia coli,"J Wang, Y Wu, Y Yan",ACS synthetic biology,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00136,"Microbial based bioplastics are promising alternatives to petroleum based synthetic plastics due to their renewability and economic feasibility. Glutarate is one of the most potential building blocks for bioplastics. The recent biosynthetic routes for glutarate were mostly based on the l-lysine degradation pathway from Pseudomonas putida that required lysine either by feeding or lysine overproduction via genetic manipulations. Herein, we established a novel glutarate biosynthetic pathway by incorporation of a â+1â carbon chain extension pathway from Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±-KG) in combination with Î±-keto acid decarboxylation pathway in Escherichia coli. Introduction of homocitrate synthase (HCS), homoaconitase (HA) and homoisocitrate dehydrogenase (HICDH) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae into E. coli enabled â+1â carbon extension from Î±-KG to Î±-ketoadipate (Î±-KA), which was subsequently converted into glutarate by a promiscuous Î±-keto acid decarboxylase (KivD) and a succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GabD). The recombinant E. coli coexpressing all five genes produced 0.3 g/L glutarate from glucose. To further improve the titers, Î±-KG was rechanneled into carbon chain extension pathway via the clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats system mediated interference (CRISPRi) of essential genes sucA and sucB in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The final strain could produce 0.42 g/L glutarate, which was increased by 40% compared with the parental strain."
Production of capsular polysaccharide from Escherichia coli K4 for biotechnological applications,"Cimini, D., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2261-8,"The production of industrially relevant microbial polysaccharides has recently gained much interest. The capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K4 is almost identical to chondroitin, a commercially valuable biopolymer that is so far obtained from animal tissues entailing complex and expensive extraction procedures. In the present study, the production of capsular polysaccharide by E. coli K4 was investigated taking into consideration a potential industrial application. Strain physiology was first characterized in shake flask experiments to determine the optimal culture conditions for the growth of the microorganism and correlate it to polysaccharide production. Results show that the concentration of carbon source greatly affects polysaccharide production, while the complex nitrogen source is mainly responsible for the build up of biomass. Small-scale batch processes were performed to further evaluate the effect of the initial carbon source concentration and of growth temperatures on polysaccharide production, finally leading to the establishment of the medium to use in following fermentation experiments on a bigger scale. The fed-batch strategy next developed on a 2-L reactor resulted in a maximum cell density of 56 g(cww)/L and a titre of capsular polysaccharide equal to 1.4 g/L, approximately ten- and fivefold higher than results obtained in shake flask and 2-L batch experiments, respectively. The release kinetics of K4 polysaccharide into the medium were also explored to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying a complex aspect of the strain physiology."
Metabolic pathway engineering for high-level production of 5-hydroxytryptophan in Escherichia coli,"Wang, H., et al.",Metab Eng,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.06.007,"Cellular metabolic networks should be carefully balanced using metabolic engineering to produce the desired products at the industrial scale. As the precursor for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is effective in treating a variety of diseases, such as depression, fibromyalgia, obesity, and cerebellar ataxia. Due to the lack of an efficient synthetic method, commercial production of 5-HTP is only achieved by extracting from the seeds of Griffonia Smplicifolia. This study reports efficient microbial production of 5-HTP via metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. Firstly, human tryptophan hydroxylase I (TPH1) gene was functionally expressed. For endogenous supply of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), human BH4 biosynthesis and regeneration pathway was reconstituted. Whole-cell bioconversion resulted in high-level production of 5-HTP (~1.2â¯g/L) from 2â¯g/L L-tryptophan in shake flasks. Further metabolic engineering efforts were employed to achieve 5-HTP biosynthesis from simple carbon sources. The whole biosynthetic pathway was divided into three functional modules, L-tryptophan module, the hydroxylation module, and the BH4 module. By reducing the copy number of L-tryptophan module, replacing TPH1 with a more stable mutant form, and promoter regulation of the BH4 module, 5-HTP was produced at a final titer of 1.3â¯g/L in the shake flask and 5.1â¯g/L in a fed-batch fermenter with glycerol as the carbon source, both of which were the highest ever reported for microbial production of 5-HTP."
LâTyrosine production by recombinant Escherichia coli: Fermentation optimization and recovery,DA Green,Biotechnology and bioengineering,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.21765,"L-Tyrosine (L-tyr) overproducing Escherichia coli strain derived from an L-phenylalanine (L-phe) overproducing strain is characterized in 10 L and 200 L scale fermentations. Deletion of the chromosomal region encoding for the pheA gene, chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase, its leader peptide (pheL) and its associated promoter resulted in significant increase in L-tyr production (Olson et al., 2007. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 74(5):1031â1040). Further increase in titer was achieved by overexpressing tyrA, encoding chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase, from a strong non-native trc promoter (Olson et al., 2007.

Fermentation optimization studies include media component selection; glucose feed optimization, antifoam agent selection, and understanding fermentation parameters affecting foaming. Generational stability of the strain was evaluated along with rate, titer, and yield of tyrosine formation from glucose. L-tyr titer of 55 g/L in 48 h was demonstrated in 200 L batches, is the highest titer published till date. We have also evaluated two primary separations schemes to isolate and purify L-tyr from the fermentation broth. Physical separation of L-tyr crystals from biomass using a decanter type centrifuge, based on the density difference between the solids, is compared and contrasted with a strategy where L-tyr is first dissolved at pH 11.5 and then acid precipitated from clarified supernatants following removal of biomass using membrane filtration. L-tyr product purity of 98% with yields ranging from 90% to 95% is demonstrated.

Efficient succinic acid production from lignocellulosic biomass by simultaneous utilization of glucose and xylose in engineered Escherichia coli,"Liu, R., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.09.052,"To enhance succinic acid formation during xylose fermentation in Escherichia coli, overexpression of ATP-forming phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) from Bacillus subtilis 168 in an ldhA, pflB, and ppc deletion strain resulted in a significant increase in cell mass and succinic acid production. However, BA204 displays a low yield of glucose fermentation and sequential glucose-xylose utilization under regulation by the phosphotransferase system (PTS). To improve the capability of glucose fermentation and simultaneously consume sugar mixture for succinic acid production, a pflB, ldhA, ppc, and ptsG deletion strain overexpressing ATP-forming PEPCK, named E. coli BA305, was constructed. As a result, after 120 h fed-batch fermentation of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate, the dry cell weight and succinic acid concentration in BA305 were 4.58 g L(-1) and 39.3 g L(-1), respectively."
Biosynthesis of ethylene glycol from d-xylose in recombinant Escherichia coli,"Wang, Y., et al.",Bioengineered,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/21655979.2018.1478489,"Ethylene glycol (EG) is an important chemical used as antifreeze and a raw material in polyester synthesis. The EG biosynthetic pathway from D-xylose with D-xylonate as key intermediate has some advantages, but showed low EG production. Here, we reconstructed and optimized this pathway in Escherichia coli. In view of the greater intracellular prevalence of NADH, an aldehyde reductase FucO using NADH was employed to convert glycoaldehyde into EG, in replacement of NADPH-dependent reductase YqhD. To suppress the accumulation of by-products acetate and glycolate, two genes arcA and aldA were knocked out. The resultant strain Q2843 produced 72 g/L EG under fed-batch fermentation conditions, with the yield of 0.40 g/g D-xylose and EG productivity of 1.38 g/L/h. The use of NADH-dependent enzyme FucO and by-product elimination significantly improved the performance of EG producing strain, which represented the highest titer, yield and productivity of EG reported so far."
Layered dynamic regulation for improving metabolic pathway productivity in Escherichia coli,"Doong, S. J., et al.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1716920115,"Microbial production of value-added chemicals from biomass is a sustainable alternative to chemical synthesis. To improve product titer, yield, and selectivity, the pathways engineered into microbes must be optimized. One strategy for optimization is dynamic pathway regulation, which modulates expression of pathway-relevant enzymes over the course of fermentation. Metabolic engineers have used dynamic regulation to redirect endogenous flux toward product formation, balance the production and consumption rates of key intermediates, and suppress production of toxic intermediates until later in the fermentation. Most cases, however, have utilized a single strategy for dynamically regulating pathway fluxes. Here we layer two orthogonal, autonomous, and tunable dynamic regulation strategies to independently modulate expression of two different enzymes to improve production of D-glucaric acid from a heterologous pathway. The first strategy uses a previously described pathway-independent quorum sensing system to dynamically knock down glycolytic flux and redirect carbon into production of glucaric acid, thereby switching cells from growth to production mode. The second strategy, developed in this work, uses a biosensor for myo-inositol (MI), an intermediate in the glucaric acid production pathway, to induce expression of a downstream enzyme upon sufficient buildup of MI. The latter, pathway-dependent strategy leads to a 2.5-fold increase in titer when used in isolation and a fourfold increase when added to a strain employing the former, pathway-independent regulatory system. The dual-regulation strain produces nearly 2 g/L glucaric acid, representing the highest glucaric acid titer reported to date in Escherichia coli K-12 strains."
Combination of the CRP mutation and ptsG deletion in Escherichia coli to efficiently synthesize xylitol from corncob hydrolysates,"Yuan, X., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10324-0,"The biotechnology-based production of xylitol has received widespread attention because it can use cheap and renewable lignocellulose as a raw material, thereby decreasing costs and pollution. The simultaneous use of various sugars in lignocellulose hydrolysates is a primary prerequisite for efficient xylitol production. In this study, a DeltaptsG and crp* combinatorial strategy was used to generate Escherichia coli W3110 strain IS5-dI, which completely eliminated glucose repression and simultaneously used glucose and xylose. This strain produced 164 g/L xylitol from detoxified corncob hydrolysates during a fed-batch fermentation in a 15-L bioreactor, which was 14.7% higher than the xylitol produced by the starting strain, IS5-d (143 g/L), and the xylitol productivity was 3.04 g/L/h. These results represent the highest xylitol concentration and productivity reported to date for bacteria and hemicellulosic sugars. Additionally, strain IS5-dG, which differs from IS5-dI at CRP amino acid residue 127 (I127G), was tolerant to the toxins in corncob hydrolysates. In a fed-batch fermentation experiment involving a 15-L bioreactor, IS5-dG produced 137 g/L xylitol from non-detoxified corncob hydrolysates, with a productivity of 1.76 g/L/h. On the basis of these results, we believe that IS5-dI and IS5-dG may be useful host strains for the industrial-scale production of xylitol from detoxified or non-detoxified corncob hydrolysates."
"Inhibition of succinic acid production in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli by neutralizing agent, organic acids, and osmolarity","Andersson, C., et al.",Biotechnol Prog,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.127,"The economical viability of biochemical succinic acid production is a result of many processing parameters including final succinic acid concentration, recovery of succinate, and the volumetric productivity. Maintaining volumetric productivities >2.5 g L(-1) h(-1) is important if production of succinic acid from renewable resources should be competitive. In this work, the effects of organic acids, osmolarity, and neutralizing agent (NH4OH, KOH, NaOH, K2CO3, and Na2CO3), and Na2CO3) on the fermentative succinic acid production by Escherichia coli AFP184 were investigated. The highest concentration of succinic acid, 77 g L(-1), was obtained with Na2CO3. In general, irrespective of the base used, succinic acid productivity per viable cell was significantly reduced as the concentration of the produced acid increased. Increased osmolarity resulting from base addition during succinate production only marginally affected the productivity per viable cell. Addition of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine to cultures resulted in an increased aerobic growth rate and anaerobic glucose consumption rate, but decreased succinic acid yield. When using NH4OH productivity completely ceased at a succinic acid concentration of approximately 40 g L(-1). Volumetric productivities remained at 2.5 g L(-1) h(-1) for up to 10 h longer when K- or Na-bases where used instead of NH4OH. The decrease in cellular succinic acid productivity observed during the anaerobic phase was found to be due to increased organic acid concentrations rather than medium osmolarity."

Photocontrol of the activities of proteins is an effective method for accurately regulating metabolic pathways. In this study, we inserted the photosensor light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain 2 of Avena sativa (AsLOV2) into selected sites of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), the key enzyme in the competitive pathway of itaconic acid (ITA) synthesis, to construct photoswitchable IDH-AsLOV2 (ILOVs). These engineered light-sensitive proteins were used to regulate the metabolic flux of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in Escherichia coli to improve ITA production. The engineered fusion proteins ILOV2, ILOV3, ILOV6, and ILOV7 exhibited effective reversibility under the oscillation of darkness and blue light illumination in vitro. The efficacies of the intracellular photoswitches were evaluated, and an optimal photocontrol strategy was established in vivo. The ITA titer was significantly enhanced to 3.30 g/L for strain ITADelta43, which displayed superior photoswitchable potency for ITA production compared with the strains that completely deleted the icd gene. The photocontrol strategy developed here can be extended for process optimization and titer improvement of other high-value bioengineering chemicals."
MEP pathway-mediated isopentenol production in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Liu, H., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-014-0135-y,"BACKGROUND: Isopentenols, such as prenol and isoprenol, are promising advanced biofuels because of their higher energy densities and better combustion efficiencies compared with ethanol. Microbial production of isopentenols has been developed recently via metabolically engineered E. coli. However, current yields remain low and the underlying pathways require systematic optimization. RESULTS: In this study, we targeted the E. coli native 2-methyl-(D)-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway and its upstream glycolysis pathway for the optimization of isopentenol production. Two codon optimized genes, nudF and yhfR from Bacillus subtilis, were synthesized and expressed in E. coli W3110 to confer the isopentenol production of the strain. Two key enzymes (IspG and Dxs) were then overexpressed to optimize the E. coli native MEP pathway, which led to a significant increase (3.3-fold) in isopentenol production. Subsequently, the glycolysis pathway was tuned to enhance the precursor and NADPH supplies for the MEP pathway by activating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and Entner-Doudoroff pathway (ED), which resulted in additional 1.9 folds of increase in isopentenol production. A 5 L-scale batch cultivation experiment was finally implemented, showing a total of 61.9 mg L(-1) isopentenol production from 20 g L(-1) of glucose. CONCLUSION: The isopentenol production was successfully increased through multi-step optimization of the MEP and its upstream glycolysis pathways. It demonstrated that the total fluxes and their balance of the precursors of the MEP pathway are of critical importance in isopentenol production. In the future, an elucidation of the contribution of PPP and ED to MEP is needed for further optimization of isopentenol production."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for efficient production of L-5-hydroxytryptophan from glucose,"Zhang, Z., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-022-01920-3,"BACKGROUND: 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the direct biosynthetic precursor of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine, has been shown to have unique efficacy in the treatment of a variety of disorders, including depression, insomnia, and chronic headaches, and is one of the most commercially valuable amino acid derivatives. However, microbial fermentation for 5-HTP production continues to face many challenges, including low titer/yield and the presence of the intermediate L-tryptophan (L-Trp), owing to the complexity and low activity of heterologous expression in prokaryotes. Therefore, there is a need to construct an efficient microbial cell factory for 5-HTP production. RESULTS: We describe the systematic modular engineering of wild-type Escherichia coli for the efficient fermentation of 5-HTP from glucose. First, a xylose-induced T7 RNA polymerase-P(T7) promoter system was constructed to ensure the efficient expression of each key heterologous pathway in E. coli. Next, a new tryptophan hydroxylase mutant was used to construct an efficient tryptophan hydroxylation module, and the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis and regeneration pathway was expressed in combination. The L-Trp synthesis module was constructed by modifying the key metabolic nodes of tryptophan biosynthesis, and the heterologous synthesis of 5-HTP was achieved. Finally, the NAD(P)H regeneration module was constructed by the moderate expression of the heterologous GDH(esi) pathway, which successfully reduced the surplus of the intermediate L-Trp. The final engineered strain HTP11 was able to produce 8.58 g/L 5-HTP in a 5-L bioreactor with a yield of 0.095 g/g glucose and a maximum real-time productivity of 0.48 g/L/h, the highest values reported by microbial fermentation. CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrate the successful design of a cell factory for high-level 5-HTP production, combined with simple processes that have potential for use in industrial applications in the future. Thus, this study provides a reference for the production of high-value amino acid derivatives using a systematic modular engineering strategy and a basis for an efficient engineered strain development of 5-HTP high-value derivatives."
Microaeration enhances productivity of bioethanol from hydrolysate of waste house wood using ethanologenic Escherichia coli KO11,"Okuda, N., et al.",J Biosci Bioeng,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1263/jbb.103.350,"This is the first study showing the successful application of waste house wood (WHW) to the pilot-scale production of bioethanol by hydrolysis using diluted acid and fermentation using the ethanologenic recombinant Escherichia coli KO11.

In anaerobic fermentation using a 5-l reactor in which the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) was 0 mmol/(l x h), KO11 consumed only 25% of the xylose in the WHW hydrolysate over the examined fermentation time of 100 h however, hexoses such as glucose and mannose were consumed completely. Microaeration at an OTR of 4 mmol/(l x h) enhanced the xylose utilization ratio of KO11 to 100%, at which the ethanol concentration was 35.4 g/l and the ethanol yield was 0.42, although the maximum ethanol concentrations were 28.8 and 26.6 g/l at OTRs of 0 mmol/(l x h) and 15 mmol/(l x h), respectively. Moreover, this microaerobic fermentation at OTR of 4 mmol/(l x h) was applied to 1000-l scale bioethanol production using the WHW hydrolysate. The xylose utilization ratio reached 100% and the ethanol yield was determined to be 0.45 for a 63-h fermentation, which were comparable to those obtained from the laboratory-scale fermentation."
Heterologous gshF gene expression in various vector systems in Escherichia coli for enhanced glutathione production,"Wang, C., et al.",J Biotechnol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.09.004,"Glutathione (GSH), an important bioactive product, is widely used in production of pharmaceuticals and foods. In this study, four different vector systems, pET28a, pUC18, pUC19-P32, and pUC19-Pabb, were applied for expression of gshF, encoding the bifunctional glutathione synthetase of Streptococcus thermophiles. These four constructs were named as pET28a-gshF, pUC18-gshF, pUC19-P32-gshF and pUC19-Pabb-gshF, respectively, and then introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for further investigation of protein expression and GSH production. The expression levels of the GshF in BL21(pUC19-P32-gshF) and BL21(pUC19-Pabb-gshF) were much lower than those of BL21(pET28a-gshF) and BL21(pUC18-gshF). In the fed-batch fermentation, the GSH accumulated by BL21(pUC18-gshF) reached 15.21 g/L, which was the highest level of GSH biosynthesis ever reported. Although BL21(pUC19-Pabb-gshF) produced less GSH compared to BL21(pUC18-gshF), the final GSH concentration produced by BL21 (pUC19-Pabb-gshF) still accumulated to 5.09 g/L, which indicated the potential application of the constitutive promoter in GSH production."
Microdiesel: Escherichia coli engineered for fuel production,"Kalscheuer, R., et al.",Microbiology (Reading),2006.0,https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.29028-0,"Biodiesel is an alternative energy source and a substitute for petroleum-based diesel fuel. It is produced from renewable biomass by transesterification of triacylglycerols from plant oils, yielding monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids with short-chain alcohols such as fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Despite numerous environmental benefits, a broader use of biodiesel is hampered by the extensive acreage required for sufficient production of oilseed crops. Therefore, processes are urgently needed to enable biodiesel production from more readily available bulk plant materials like sugars or cellulose. Toward this goal, the authors established biosynthesis of biodiesel-adequate FAEEs, referred to as Microdiesel, in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. This was achieved by heterologous expression in E. coli of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase and the unspecific acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1. By this approach, ethanol formation was combined with subsequent esterification of the ethanol with the acyl moieties of coenzyme A thioesters of fatty acids if the cells were cultivated under aerobic conditions in the presence of glucose and oleic acid. Ethyl oleate was the major constituent of these FAEEs, with minor amounts of ethyl palmitate and ethyl palmitoleate. FAEE concentrations of 1.28 g l(-1) and a FAEE content of the cells of 26 % of the cellular dry mass were achieved by fed-batch fermentation using renewable carbon sources. This novel approach might pave the way for industrial production of biodiesel equivalents from renewable resources by employing engineered micro-organisms, enabling a broader use of biodiesel-like fuels in the future."

In order to achieve the biobased production of 5AVA, a 2-keto-6-aminocaproate-mediated synthetic pathway was established. Combination of L-Lysine alpha-oxidase from Scomber japonicus, alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase from Lactococcus lactis and aldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli could achieve the biosynthesis of 5AVA from biobased L-Lysine in E. coli. The H(2)O(2) produced by L-Lysine alpha-oxidase was decomposed by the expression of catalase KatE. Finally, 52.24 g/L of 5AVA were obtained through fed-batch biotransformation. Moreover, homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation analyses were used to identify mutation sites and propose a possible trait-improvement strategy: the expanded catalytic channel of mutant and more hydrogen bonds formed might be beneficial for the substrates stretch. In summary, we have developed a promising artificial pathway for efficient 5AVA synthesis."

N., et al.",Metab Eng,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.04.020,"D-glucaric acid is a promising platform compound used to synthesize many other value-added or commodity chemicals. The engineering of Escherichia coli for efficiently converting D-glucose to D-glucaric acid has been attempted for several years, with mixed sugar fermentation recently gaining growing interests due to the increased D-glucaric acid yield. Here, we co-expressed cscB, cscA, cscK, ino1, miox, udh, and suhB in E. coli BL21 (DE3), functionally constructing an unreported route from sucrose to D-glucaric acid. Further deletion of chromosomal zwf, pgi, ptsG, uxaC, gudD, over-expression of glk, and use of a D-fructose-dependent translation control system for pgi enabled the strain to use sucrose as the sole carbon source while achieving a high product titer and yield.

For overexpression of hGH, effects of eight factors including temperature, type and concentration of carbon source, IPTG and MgSO(4) , buffering capacity, induction time, yeast extract/peptone ratio on rhGH production were studied by Plackett-Burman screening. Maximum production of rhGH was 0.681 g/L, and results of statistical analysis showed that induction temperature and glucose have the greatest effect and the presence of MgSO(4) increases rhGH expression and reduces biomass concentration. So, the effect of ethanol and MgSO(4) concentrations on the rhGH production was examined according to the central composite experimental design. The ANOVA of the results showed rhGH production increases to 1.128 g/L in 4 g/L MgSO(4) and 1% ethanol. Then, the impact of glucose concentration and induction time on the rhGH production was evaluated in two levels in the fermenter by Taguchi statistical method. Under optimum conditions, OD(600nm) 4 and 10 g/L glucose crude rhGH concentration 4.17 g/L was obtained, which is one of the highest value ever reported. Finally, rhGH was purified using the biophysical and biochemical techniques comprising circular dichroism, fluorescent spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering, and it was confirmed that the produced protein is comparable to the commercial standard sample."

We previously achieved high-yield LNT biosynthesis (57.5 g/L) using fed-batch fermentation however, residual lacto-N-triose II (LNTri II) was also found (21.58 g/L). Here, we re-engineered an efficient LNT-producing Escherichia coli with low LNTri II accumulation using genetically stable LNTri II-producing strains with a genomic insertion of lgtA (encoding beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase). Comparable and low titers of LNT (3.73-4.61 g/L) and LNTri II (0.33-0.63 g/L), respectively, were obtained by introducing beta1,3-galactosyltransferase. To reduce residual LNTri II, the E. coli transporter gene setA was disrupted, obviously reducing the accumulation of LNTri II and LNT. Next, the gene encoding beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (BbhI) was introduced into LNT-producing strains or E. coli BL21(DE3) for single- or mixed-strain cultivation, respectively.

Synthetic redesign of Escherichia coli for cadaverine production from galactose,"Kwak, D. H., et al.",Biotechnol Biofuels,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-017-0707-2,"BACKGROUND: With increasing concerns over the environment, biological production of cadaverine has been suggested as an alternative route to replace polyamides generated from the petroleum-based process. For an ideal bioprocess, cadaverine should be produced with high yield and productivity from various sugars abundant in biomass. However, most microorganisms are not able to efficiently metabolize other biomass-derived sugars as fast as glucose. This results in reduced growth rate and low carbon flux toward the production of desired bio-chemicals. Thus, redesign of microorganisms is necessary for utilizing those carbon sources with enhanced carbon flux and product formation. RESULTS: In this study, we engineered Escherichia coli to produce cadaverine with rapid assimilation of galactose, a promising future feedstock. To achieve this, genes related to the metabolic pathway were maximally expressed to amplify the flux toward cadaverine production via synthetic expression cassettes consisting of predictive and quantitative genetic parts (promoters, 5'-untranslated regions, and terminators). Furthermore, the feedback inhibition of metabolic enzymes and degradation/re-uptake pathways was inactivated to robustly produce cadaverine. Finally, the resultant strain, DHK4, produced 8.80 g/L cadaverine with high yield (0.170 g/g) and productivity (0.293 g/L/h) during fed-batch fermentation, which was similar to or better than the previous glucose fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, synthetic redesign of a microorganism with predictive and quantitative genetic parts is a prerequisite for converting sugars from abundant biomass into desired platform chemicals. This is the first report to produce cadaverine from galactose. Moreover, the yield (0.170 g/g) was the highest among engineered E. coli systems."
Effective production of human growth factors in Escherichia coli by fusing with small protein 6HFh8,"Kim, Y. S., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-020-01502-1,"BACKGROUND: Growth factors (GFs) are signaling proteins that affect cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and differentiation. GFs are used as cosmeceuticals, exerting anti-wrinkle, anti-aging, and whitening effects, and also as pharmaceuticals to treat wounds, growth failure, and oral mucositis. However, in mammalian and bacterial cells, low productivity and expression in inclusion bodies, respectively, of GFs does not satisfy the consumer demand. Here, we aimed to develop a bacterial expression system that produces high yields of soluble GFs that can be purified in their native forms. RESULTS: We present Fh8, an 8-kDa peptide from Fasciola hepatica with an N-terminal hexa-histidine (6HFh8), as a fusion partner for enhanced human GF production in recombinant Escherichia coli. The fusion partner harboring a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site was fused to the N-terminus of 10 human GFs: acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF, respectively), epidermal growth factor (EGF), human growth hormone (hGH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165), keratinocyte growth factor 1 (KGF-1), placental growth factor (PGF), stem cell factor (SCF), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli under the control of T7 promoter at three temperatures (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 37 degrees C). All individual fusion proteins, except for SCF and TIMP-1, were successfully overexpressed in cytoplasmic soluble form at more than one temperature. Further, the original aFGF, IGF-1, EGF, and VEGF165 proteins were cleaved from the fusion partner by TEV protease. Five-liter fed-batch fermentation approaches for the 6HFh8-aFGF (lacking disulfide bonds) and 6HFh8-VEGF165 (a cysteine-rich protein) were devised to obtain the target protein at concentrations of 9.7 g/l and 3.4 g/l, respectively. The two GFs were successfully highly purified (> 99% purity). Furthermore, they exerted similar cell proliferative effects as those of their commercial equivalents. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that 6HFh8-GF fusion proteins could be overexpressed on a g/l scale in the cytoplasm of E. coli, with the GFs subsequently highly purified and maintaining their biological activity. Hence, the small protein 6HFh8 can be used for efficient mass-production of various GFs."
Metabolic engineering of a xylose pathway for biotechnological production of glycolate in Escherichia coli,"Liu, M., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-018-0900-4,"BACKGROUND: Glycolate is a valuable chemical with extensive applications in many different fields. The traditional methods to synthesize glycolate are quite expensive and toxic. So, the biotechnological production of glycolate from sustainable feedstocks is of interest for its potential economic and environmental advantages. D-Xylose is the second most abundant sugar in nature and accounts for 18-30% of sugar in lignocellulose. New routes for the conversion of xylose to glycolate were explored. RESULTS: Overexpression of aceA and ghrA and deletion of aceB in Escherichia coli were examined for glycolate production from xylose, but the conversion was initially ineffective. Then, a new route for glycolate production was established in E. coli by introducing NAD(+)-dependent xylose dehydrogenase (xdh) and xylonolactonase (xylC) from Caulobacter crescentus. The constructed engineered strain Q2562 produced 28.82 +/- 0.56 g/L glycolate from xylose with 0.60 +/- 0.01 g/L/h productivity and 0.38 +/- 0.07 g/g xylose yield. However, 27.18 +/- 2.13 g/L acetate was accumulated after fermentation. Deletions of iclR and ackA were used to overcome the acetate excretion. An ackA knockout resulted in about 66% decrease in acetate formation. The final engineered strain Q2742 produced 43.60 +/- 1.22 g/L glycolate, with 0.91 +/- 0.02 g/L/h productivity and 0.46 +/- 0.03 g/g xylose yield. CONCLUSIONS: A new route for glycolate production from xylose was established, and an engineered strain Q2742 was constructed from this new explored pathway. The engineering strain showed the highest reported productivity of glycolate to date. This research opened up a new prospect for bio-refinery of xylose and an alternative choice for industrial production of glycolate."
An integrated computational and experimental study for overproducing fatty acids in Escherichia coli,"Ranganathan, S., et al.",Metab Eng,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2012.08.008,"Increasing demands for petroleum have stimulated sustainable ways to produce chemicals and biofuels. Specifically, fatty acids of varying chain lengths (C(6)-C(1)(6)) naturally synthesized in many organisms are promising starting points for the catalytic production of industrial chemicals and diesel-like biofuels. However, bio-production of fatty acids from plants and other microbial production hosts relies heavily on manipulating tightly regulated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. In addition, precursors for fatty acids are used along other central metabolic pathways for the production of amino acids and biomass, which further complicates the engineering of microbial hosts for higher yields. Here, we demonstrate an iterative metabolic engineering effort that integrates computationally driven predictions and metabolic flux analysis techniques to meet this challenge. The OptForce procedure was used for suggesting and prioritizing genetic manipulations that overproduce fatty acids of different chain lengths from C(6) to C(1)(6) starting with wild-type E. coli. We identified some common but mostly chain-specific genetic interventions alluding to the possibility of fine-tuning overproduction for specific fatty acid chain lengths. In accordance with the OptForce prioritization of interventions, fabZ and acyl-ACP thioesterase were upregulated and fadD was deleted to arrive at a strain that produces 1.70 g/L and 0.14 g fatty acid/g glucose ( approximately 39% maximum theoretical yield) of C(1)(4)(-)(1)(6) fatty acids in minimal M9 medium. These results highlight the benefit of using computational strain design and flux analysis tools in the design of recombinant strains of E. coli to produce free fatty acids."

However, further enhancement of fatty acid biosynthesis in this cell line proved unpredictable. To develop a more reliable engineering strategy, a cell-free system was developed that enabled direct, quantitative investigation of fatty acid biosynthesis and its regulation in E. coli. Using this system, the strong dependence of fatty acid synthesis on malonyl-CoA availability and several important phenomena in fatty acid synthesis were verified. Results from this cell-free system were confirmed via the generation and analysis of metabolically engineered strains of E. coli. Our quantitative findings highlight the enormous catalytic potential of the E. coli fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, and target specific steps for protein and metabolic engineering to enhance the catalytic conversion of glucose into biodiesel."
Model-driven intracellular redox status modulation for increasing isobutanol production in Escherichia coli,"Liu, J., et al.",Biotechnol Biofuels,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-015-0291-2,"BACKGROUND: Few strains have been found to produce isobutanol naturally. For building a high performance isobutanol-producing strain, rebalancing redox status of the cell was very crucial through systematic investigation of redox cofactors metabolism. Then, the metabolic model provided a powerful tool for the rational modulation of the redox status. RESULTS: Firstly, a starting isobutanol-producing E. coli strain LA02 was engineered with only 2.7 g/L isobutanol produced. Then, the genome-scale metabolic modeling was specially carried out for the redox cofactor metabolism of the strain LA02 by combining flux balance analysis and minimization of metabolic adjustment, and the GAPD reaction catalyzed by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was predicted as the key target for redox status improvement. Under guidance of the metabolic model prediction, a gapN-encoding NADP(+) dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pathway was constructed and then fine-tuned using five constitutive promoters. The best strain LA09 was obtained with the strongest promoter BBa_J23100. The NADPH/NADP + ratios of strain LA09 reached 0.67 at exponential phase and 0.64 at stationary phase. The redox modulations resulted in the decrease production of ethanol and lactate by 17.5 and 51.7% to 1.32 and 6.08 g/L, respectively. Therefore, the isobutanol titer was increased by 221% to 8.68 g/L. CONCLUSIONS: This research has achieved rational redox status improvement of isobutanol-producing strain under guidance of the prediction and modeling of the genome-scale metabolic model of isobutanol-producing E. coli strain with the aid of synthetic promoters. Therefore, the production of isobutanol was dramatically increased by 2.21-fold from 2.7 to 8.68 g/L. Moreover, the developed model-driven method special for redox cofactor metabolism was of very helpful to the redox status modulation of other bio-products."

According to the batch fermentations, the strain overexpressing PCK produced more GFP and AP with a lower increase in biomass than the control strain. In a chemostat culture (D = 0.7 h(-1)), the GFP production in the PCK overexpressing strain was 99.0 +/- 4.31 mg/g cell, with a biomass of 0.22 g/L, while that of the control strain was 53.5 +/- 3.07 mg/g cell, with a biomass of 0.35 g/L.

In this study, we applied singleplex and multiplex genome engineering approaches to construct an E. coli strain for the production of L-DOPA from glucose. We first used the singleplex genome engineering approach to create an L-DOPA-producing strain, E. coli DOPA-1, by deleting transcriptional regulators (tyrosine repressor tyrR and carbon storage regulator A csrA), altering glucose transport from the phosphotransferase system (PTS) to ATP-dependent uptake and the phosphorylation system overexpressing galactose permease gene (galP) and glucokinase gene (glk), knocking out glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (zwf) and prephenate dehydratase and its leader peptide genes (pheLA) and integrating the fusion protein chimera of the downstream pathway of chorismate. Then, multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) based on 23 targets was used to further improve L-DOPA production. The resulting strain, E. coli DOPA-30N, produced 8.67 g/L of L-DOPA in 60 h in a 5 L fed-batch fermentation.

MA is a potential platform chemical for the manufacture of several widely-used consumer plastics; while SA is mainly used for producing pharmaceuticals (for example, aspirin and lamivudine) and skincare and haircare products. At present, MA and SA are commercially produced by organic chemical synthesis using petro-derived aromatic chemicals, such as benzene, as starting materials, which is not environmentally friendly. Here, we report a novel approach for efficient microbial production of MA via extending shikimate pathway by introducing the hybrid of an SA biosynthetic pathway with its partial degradation pathway. First, we engineered a well-developed phenylalanine producing Escherichia coli strain into an SA overproducer by introducing isochorismate synthase and isochorismate pyruvate lyase. The engineered strain is able to produce 1.2 g/L of SA from simple carbon sources, which is the highest titer reported so far. Further, the partial SA degradation pathway involving salicylate 1-monoxygenase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase is established to achieve the conversion of SA to MA. Finally, a de novo MA biosynthetic pathway is assembled by integrating the established SA biosynthesis and degradation modules. Modular optimization enables the production of up to 1.5 g/L MA within 48 h in shake flasks. This study not only establishes an efficient microbial platform for the production of SA and MA, but also demonstrates a generalizable pathway design strategy for the de novo biosynthesis of valuable degradation metabolites."

Development of microbial strains for high-level L-homoserine production is an attractive research direction in recent years. Herein, we converted a wild-type Escherichia coli to a non-auxotrophic and plasmid-free hyperproducer of L-homoserine using systematically metabolic engineer strategies. First, an initial strain was obtained through regulating L-homoserine degradation pathway and enhancing synthetic flow. To facilitate L-homoserine production, flux-control genes were tuned by optimizing the copy numbers in chromosome, and transport system was modified to promote L-homoserine efflux. Subsequently, a strategy of cofactors synergistic utilization was proposed and successfully applied to achieve L-homoserine hyperproduction. The final engineered strain could efficiently produce 85.29 g/L L-homoserine, which was the highest production level ever reported from a plasmid-free, antibiotic-free, inducer-free and nonauxotrophic strain.

"Constructing a synthetic constitutive metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli for (R, R)-2,3-butanediol production","Tong, Y. J., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7013-3,"Many microorganisms could naturally produce (R, R)-2,3-butanediol ((R, R)-2,3-BD), which has unique applications due to its special chiral group and spatial configuration. But the low enantio-purity of the product hindered the development of large-scale production. In this work, a synthetic constitutive metabolic pathway for enantiomerically pure (R, R)-2,3-BD biosynthesis was constructed in Escherichia coli with vector pUC6S, which does not contain any lac sequences. The expression of this artificial constructed gene cluster was optimized by using two different strength of promoters (AlperPLTet01 (P01) and AlperBB (PBB)). The strength of P01 is twice stronger than PBB. The fermentation results suggested that the yield of (R, R)-2,3-BD was higher when using the stronger promoter. Compared with the wild type, the recombinant strain E. coli YJ2 produced a small amount of acetic acid and showed higher glucose consumption rate and higher cell density, which indicated a protection against acetic acid inhibition. In order to further increase the (R, R)-2,3-BD production by reducing the accumulation of its precursor acetoin, the synthetic operon was reconstructed by adding the strong promoter P01 in front of the gene ydjL coding for the enzyme of (R, R)-2,3-BD dehydrogenase which catalyzes the conversion of acetoin to (R, R)-2,3-BD. The engineered strain E. coli YJ3 showed a 20 % decrease in acetoin production compared with that of E. coli YJ2. After optimization the fermentation conditions, 30.5 g/L of (R, R)-2,3-BD and 3.2 g/L of acetoin were produced from 80 g/L of glucose within 18 h, with an enantio-purity over 99 %."
Highly efficient production of ectoine via an optimized combination of precursor metabolic modules in Escherichia coli BL21,"Xu, S., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2023.129803,"Ectoine is an osmotic pressure protectant observed in various microorganisms and is widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The market value of ectoine has increased considerably with social progress, resulting in high demand for ectoine production technology. Herein, a microbial cell factory in Escherichia coli that produces ectoine at high titers is described as developing efficient and environmentally friendly bio-based ectoine production technology. The ectoine biosynthetic pathway of Halomonas hydrothermalis was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Subsequent overexpression of precursor metabolic modules, including aspartate branching, pyruvate-oxoacetate, and glutamate biosynthesis pathways, resulted in the final strain, E. coli BCT08, which produced ectoine at a titer of 36.58 g/L during 30 h of fermentation. Sugar feeding speed optimization improved the ectoine titer to 131.8 g/L after 96 h of cultivation. This represents a remarkable achievement in ectoine production from glucose under low-salt conditions and has vast potential for industrial applications."
Modification of tryptophan transport system and its impact on production of L-tryptophan in Escherichia coli,"Liu, Q., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.088,"The production of L-tryptophan through chemical synthesis, direct fermentation, bioconversion and enzymatic conversion has been reported. However, the role of transport system for aromatic amino acids in L-tryptophan producing strains has not been fully explored. In this study, the fact was revealed that L-tryptophan production and cell growth were affected by the modification of transport systems based on YddG functioning as aromatic amino acid excretion and AroP functioning as general aromatic amino acid permease. Through comparing glucose conversion rates of recombinant strains such as Escherichia coli TRTH DeltaaroP, E. coli TRTH-Y, and E. coli TRTH DeltaaroP-Y, the moderate modification of transport system resulted in the metabolic flux redistribution of L-tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. In the fed-batch fermentation by E. coli TRTH and E. coli TRTH-Y in 30-liter fermentor, the final production of L-tryptophan fermented by E. coli TRTH-Y was 36.3 g/L, which was 12.6% higher than fermentation by E. coli TRTH."
"Rational, combinatorial, and genomic approaches for engineering L-tyrosine production in Escherichia coli","CNS Santos, W Xiaoâ¦",PNAS,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1206346109,"Although microbial metabolic engineering has traditionally relied on rational and knowledge-driven techniques, significant improvements in strain performance can be further obtained through the use of combinatorial approaches exploiting phenotypic diversification and screening. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of global transcriptional machinery engineering and a high-throughput L-tyrosine screen towards improving L-tyrosine production in Escherichia coli. This methodology succeeded in generating three strains from two separate mutagenesis libraries (rpoA and rpoD) exhibiting up to a 114% increase in L-tyrosine titer over a rationally engineered parental strain with an already high capacity for production. Subsequent strain characterization through transcriptional analysis and whole genome sequencing allowed complete phenotype reconstruction from well-defined mutations and point to important roles for both the acid stress resistance pathway and the stringent response of E. coli in imparting this phenotype. As such, this study presents one of the first examples in which cell-wide measurements have helped to elucidate the genetic and biochemical underpinnings of an engineered cellular property, leading to the total restoration of metabolite overproduction from specific chromosomal mutations."
L-arabonate and D-galactonate production by expressing a versatile sugar dehydrogenase in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Liu, H., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.03.056,"The production of L-arabonate and D-galactonate employing a versatile l-arabinose dehydrogenase (AraDH) from Azospirillum brasilense is presented. The promiscuity of AraDH is manifested by its appreciable activity towards L-arabinose and D-galactose as substrates, and NAD(+) and NADP(+) as cofactors. The AraDH was introduced into an engineered Escherichia coli with inactive L-arabinose or D-galactose metabolism, resulting in strains EMA2 and EWG4, respectively. EMA2 produced 43.9 g L(-1)L-arabonate with a productivity of 1.22 g L(-1)h(-1) and 99.1% (mol/mol) yield. After methanol precipitation, 92.6% of L-arabonate potassium salt was recovered with a purity of 88.8%. Meanwhile, EWG4 produced 24.0 g L(-1)D-galactonate, which is 36% higher than that of the strain carrying the specific d-galactose dehydrogenase. Overall results reveal that the versatility of AraDH to efficiently catalyze the formation of L-arabonate and D-galactonate could be a useful tool in advancing industrial viability for sugar acids production."
High production of fatty alcohols in Escherichia coli with fatty acid starvation,"Liu, Y., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-016-0524-5,"BACKGROUND: Microbial biofuel synthesis attracting increasing attention. Great advances have been made in producing fatty alcohols from fatty acyl-CoAs and fatty acids in Escherichia coli. However, the low titers and limited knowledge regarding the basic characteristics of fatty alcohols, such as location and toxicity, have hampered large-scale industrialization. Further research is still needed. RESULTS: In this study, we designed a novel and efficient strategy to enhance fatty alcohol production by inducing fatty acid starvation. We report the first use of deletions of acyl-ACP thioesterases to enhance fatty alcohol production. Transcriptional analysis was conducted to investigate the mechanism of the designed strategy. Then, fatty alcohol production was further enhanced by deletion of genes from competing pathways. Fatty alcohols were shown to be extracellular products with low toxicity. The final strain, E. coli MGL2, produced fatty alcohols at the remarkable level of 6.33 g/L under fed-batch fermentation, representing the highest reported titer of fatty alcohols produced by microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Deletions of genes responsible for synthesis of fatty acids and competing products are promising strategies for fatty alcohol production. Our investigation of the location and toxicity of fatty alcohols suggest bright future for fatty alcohol production in E. coli."
Improving the production of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in Escherichia coli by overexpressing metk,"Yu, P. and P. Zhu",Prep Biochem Biotechnol,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2017.1350976,"S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) has important applications in many fields including chemical therapy and pharmaceutical industry. In this study, the recombinant Escherichia coli strain was constructed for effective production of SAM by introducing the SAM synthase gene (metK). This strain produced 34.5 mg/L of SAM in basic medium in shake flask. Yeast extract, pH, and loaded volume had a significant positive effect on the yield of SAM. Their optimal values were 35 g/L, 7.5, and 30 mL, respectively. The final conditions optimized were as follows: glucose 20, g/L peptone, 40 g/L yeast extract, 35 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L MgSO(4), 1.2 g/L L-methionine, 1 g/L rotate speed, 220 rpm loaded volume, 30 mL inoculation, 1% temperature, 37 degrees C and initial medium, pH 7.5.

Overproduction of free fatty acids in E. coli: implications for biodiesel production,"Lu, X., et al.",Metab Eng,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2008.08.006,"Whereas microbial fermentation processes for producing ethanol and related alcohol biofuels are well established, biodiesel (methyl esters of fatty acids) is exclusively derived from plant oils. Slow cycle times for engineering oilseed metabolism and the excessive accumulation of glycerol as a byproduct are two major drawbacks of deriving biodiesel from plants. Although most bacteria produce fatty acids as cell envelope precursors, the biosynthesis of fatty acids is tightly regulated at multiple levels. By introducing four distinct genetic changes into the E. coli genome, we have engineered an efficient producer of fatty acids. Under fed-batch, defined media fermentation conditions, 2.5 g/L fatty acids were produced by this metabolically engineered E. coli strain, with a specific productivity of 0.024 g/h/g dry cell mass and a peak conversion efficiency of 4.8% of the carbon source into fatty acid products. At least 50% of the fatty acids produced were present in the free acid form."
Enhancement of Sulfur Conversion Rate in the Production of l-Cysteine by Engineered Escherichia coli,"Liu, H., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b06330,"Cysteine is a commercially important sulfur-containing amino acid widely used as a supplement in the agricultural and food industries. It is extremely desirable to achieve a high sulfur conversion rate in the fermentation-based cysteine production. Here, the metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli was performed to enhance the sulfur conversion rate in cysteine biosynthesis. Accordingly, the reduction of sulfur loss by the regulator decR and its yhaOM operons were deleted. serACB was integrated into chromosome with constitutive promoter to coordinately increase sulfur utilization. The sulfur assimilation pathways and sulfur transcriptional regulator cysB were overexpressed to regulate sulfur metabolism and enhance sulfur conversion significantly. After the process optimization in fed-batch fermentation, LH16 [SLH02 DeltayhaM Ptrc1-serACB-cysM-nrdH-(pLH03, pTrc99a-cysB)] produced 7.5 g/L of cysteine with a sulfur conversion rate of 90.11%.

Development and evaluation of efficient recombinant Escherichia coli strains for the production of 3âhydroxypropionic acid from glycerol,C Rathnasingh,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.22429,"3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a commercially valuable chemical with the potential to be a key building block for deriving many industrially important chemicals. However, its biological production has not been well documented. Our previous study demonstrated the feasibility of producing 3-HP from glycerol using the recombinant Escherichia coli SH254 expressing glycerol dehydratase (DhaB) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldH), and reported that an âimbalance between the two enzymesâ and the âinstability of the first enzyme DhaBâ were the major factors limiting 3-HP production. In this study, the efficiency of the recombinant strain(s) was improved by expressing DhaB and AldH in two compatible isopropyl-thio-Î²-galactoside (IPTG) inducible plasmids along with glycerol dehydratase reactivase (GDR). The expression levels of the two proteins were measured. It was found that the changes in protein expression were associated with their enzymatic activity and balance. While cloning an alternate aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), Î±-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase (KGSADH), instead of AldH, the recombinant E. coli SH-BGK1 showed the highest level of 3-HP production (2.8âg/L) under shake-flask conditions. When an aerobic fed-batch process was carried out under bioreactor conditions at pH 7.0, the recombinant SH-BGK1 produced 38.7âg 3-HP/L with an average yield of 35%.

Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for de novo production of L-DOPA from D-glucose,"Fordjour, E., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-019-1122-0,"BACKGROUND: Production of L-tyrosine is gaining grounds as the market size of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) is expected to increase due to increasing cases of Parkinson's disease a neurodegenerative disease. Attempts to overproduce L-tyrosine for conversion to L-DOPA has stemmed on the overexpressing of critical pathway enzymes, an introduction of feedback-resistant enzymes, and deregulation of transcriptional regulators. RESULTS: An E. coli BL21 (DE3) was engineered by deleting tyrR, ptsG, crr, pheA and pykF while directing carbon flow through the overexpressing of galP and glk. TktA and PpsA were also overexpressed to enhance the accumulation of E4P and PEP. Directed evolution was then applied on HpaB to optimize its activity. Three mutants, G883R, G883A, L1231M, were identified to have improved activity as compared to the wild-type hpaB showing a 3.03-, 2.9- and 2.56-fold increase in L-DOPA production respectively. The use of strain LP-8 resulted in the production of 691.24 mg/L and 25.53 g/L of L-DOPA in shake flask and 5 L bioreactor, respectively. CONCLUSION: Deletion of key enzymes to channel flux towards the shikimate pathway coupled with the overexpression of pathway enzymes enhanced the availability of L-tyrosine for L-DOPA production. Enhancing the activity of HpaB increased L-DOPA production from glucose and glycerol. This work demonstrates that increasing the availability of L-tyrosine and enhancing enzyme activity ensures maximum L-DOPA productivity."
Production of biobutanol from cellulose hydrolysate by the Escherichia coli co-culture system,"Saini, M., et al.",FEMS Microbiol Lett,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnw008,"The commercialization of the n-butanol bioprocess is largely dependent on the price of feedstocks. Renewable cellulose appears to be an appealing feedstock. The microbial production of n-butanol still remains challenging because of the limited availability of intracellular NADH. To address this issue, an Escherichia coli strain carrying the clostridial CoA-dependent pathway was supplied with heterologous formate dehydrogenase. With the cellulose hydrolysate of rice straw, this single strain produced cellulosic biobutanol with a production yield at 35% of the theoretical and a productivity of 0.093 g L(-1) h(-1). In an alternative method, the production involved a co-culture system consisting of two separate strains provided with the full CoA-dependent pathway. This system achieved a production yield and productivity reaching 62.8% of the theoretical and 0.163 g L(-1) h(-1), respectively. The result indicates that the E. coli co-culture system is technically promising for the production of cellulosic biobutanol."

The optimal conditions for pretreatment of corn stover (10%, w/v) were: 0.75% H2SO4, 160 degrees C, and 0-5 min holding time. The conditions were chosen based on maximum glucose release after enzymatic hydrolysis, minimum loss of pentose sugars and minimum formation of sugar degradation products such as furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural. The pretreated corn stover after enzymatic saccharification generated 63.2 +/- 2.2 and 63.7 +/- 2.3 g total sugars per L at 0 and 5 min holding time, respectively. Furfural production was 0.45 +/- 0.1 and 0.87 +/- 0.4 g/L, respectively.

Optimization of glucose feeding approaches for enhanced glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine production by an engineered Escherichia coli,"Chen, X., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-011-1046-0,"In this work, a recombinant Escherichia coli was constructed by overexpressing glucosamine (GlcN) synthase and GlcN-6-P N-acetyltransferase for highly efficient production of GlcN and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). For further enhancement of GlcN and GlcNAc production, the effects of different glucose feeding strategies including constant-rate feeding, interval feeding, and exponential feeding on GlcN and GlcNAc production were investigated. The results indicated that exponential feeding resulted in relatively high cell growth rate and low acetate formation rate, while constant feeding contributed to the highest specific GlcN and GlcNAc production rate. Based on this, a multistage glucose supply approach was proposed to enhance GlcN and GlcNAc production. In the first stage (0-2 h), batch culture with initial glucose concentration of 27 g/l was conducted, whereas the second culture stage (2-10 h) was performed with exponential feeding at mu (set) = 0.20 h(-)(1), followed by feeding concentrated glucose (300 g/l) at constant rate of 32 ml/h in the third stage (10-16 h). With this time-variant glucose feeding strategy, the total GlcN and GlcNAc yield reached 69.66 g/l, which was enhanced by 1.59-fold in comparison with that of batch culture with the same total glucose concentration. The time-dependent glucose feeding approach developed here may be useful for production of other fine chemicals by recombinant E. coli."

In this work, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) were identified from Comamonas testosteroni SC1588 for the oxidation of bio-based furans into furan carboxylic acids. Of the whole-cell biocatalysts constructed, Escherichia coli expressing a vanillin dehydrogenase (E. coli_CtVDH1) proved to be the best for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) was obtained in the yield of approximately 92 % within 12 h using this recombinant strain when the HMF concentration was up to 200 mM. In a fed-batch process, 292 mM of HMFCA was produced within 20.5 h, thereby providing a productivity as high as 2.0 g/L h. Other furan carboxylic acids were synthesized in the yields of 83-95%. Besides, the partially purified HMF was smoothly converted into HMFCA by this recombinant strain, with a 90% yield."
Accumulation of pyruvate by changing the redox status in Escherichia coli,"Ojima, Y., et al.",Biotechnol Lett,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0842-y,"Pyruvate was produced from glucose by Escherichia coli BW25113 that contained formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Mycobacterium vaccae. In aerobic shake-flask culture (K (L) a = 4.9 min(-1)), the recombinant strain produced 6.7 g pyruvate l(-1) after 24 h with 4 g sodium formate l(-1) and a yield of 0.34 g pyruvate g glucose(-1). These values were higher than those of the original strain (0.2 g l(-1) pyruvate and 0.02 g pyruvate g glucose(-1)). Based on the reaction mechanism of FDH, the introduction of FDH into E. coli enhances the accumulation of pyruvate by the regeneration of NADH from NAD(+) since NAD(+) is a shared cosubstrate with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which decarboxylates pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO(2). The oxygenation level was enough high to inactivate lactate dehydrogenase, which was of benefit to pyruvate accumulation without lactate as a by-product."
Engineering the production of dipicolinic acid in E. coli,"McClintock, M. K., et al.",Metab Eng,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.05.009,"Dicarboxylic acids, such as the phthalic acids and their derivatives, are monomeric components in several important polyesters and polyamides. In most cases, these compounds are derived from fossil fuels and are not easily biodegradable. Dipicolinic acid (DPA) is a biologically derived aromatic di-acid that has a similar structure to isophthalic acid. Furthermore, DPA has been shown to give rise to polyesters, is readily biodegradable, and is non-toxic. DPA is naturally produced by Bacillus and Clostridium species during sporulation and can comprise up to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. In this paper we demonstrate the first heterologous production of DPA and identify the genes appropriate for gram-scale production in the industrial workhorse organism, E. coli. Initially, several combinations of genes from the lysine pathway, including lysC, asd, dapA, and dapB, were overexpressed to determine which genes are necessary for recombinant production in E. coli. The in vitro activity of dipicolinate synthase was then compared between Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium perfringens. Next, in order to improve DPA production from glucose, an optimized strain was created that lacked several genes (lysA, tdh, and metA), resulting in 5.21â¯g/L DPA when 5â¯g/L of aspartate was supplied. Then, several aspartate kinases and dipicolinate synthases were screened for optimal activity in E. coli. The optimal genes were combined with the overexpression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to develop a full biosynthetic pathway capable of producing a titer of 4.7â¯g/L DPA directly from glucose. In summary, we have performed a detailed biochemical study of the key pathway enzyme dipicolinate synthase and achieved scalable heterogeneous production of DPA in the workhorse organism E. coli."
Rewiring carbon flux in Escherichia coli using a bifunctional molecular switch,"Hou, J., et al.",Metab Eng,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.05.004,"The unbalanced distribution of carbon flux in microbial cell factories can lead to inefficient production and poor cell growth. Uncoupling cell growth and chemical synthesis can therefore improve microbial cell factory efficiency. Such uncoupling, which requires precise manipulation of carbon fluxes, can be achieved by up-regulating or down-regulating the expression of enzymes of various pathways. In this study, a dynamic turn-off switch (dTFS) and a dynamic turn-on switch (dTNS) were constructed using growth phase-dependent promoters and degrons. By combining the dTFS and dTNS, a bifunctional molecular switch that could orthogonally regulate two target proteins was introduced. This bifunctional molecular switch was used to uncouple cell growth from shikimic acid and D-glucaric acid synthesis, resulting in the production of 14.33 g/L shikimic acid and the highest reported productivity of D-glucaric acid (0.0325 g/L/h) in Escherichia coli MG1655. This proved that the bifunctional molecular switch could rewire carbon fluxes by controlling target protein abundance."
High yield production of D-xylonic acid from D-xylose using engineered Escherichia coli,"Liu, H., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.08.065,"An engineered Escherichia coli was constructed to produce D-xylonic acid, one of the top 30 high-value chemicals identified by US Department of Energy. The native pathway for D-xylose catabolism in E. coli W3110 was blocked by disrupting xylose isomerase (XI) and xylulose kinase (XK) genes. The native pathway for xylonic acid catabolism was also blocked by disrupting two genes both encoding xylonic acid dehydratase (yagE and yjhG). Through the introduction of a D-xylose dehydrogenase from Caulobacter crescentus, a D-xylonic acid producing E. coli was constructed. The recombinant E. coli produced up to 39.2 g L(-1) D-xylonic acid from 40 g L(-1) D-xylose in M9 minimal medium. The average productivity was as high as 1.09 g L(-1) h(-1) and no gluconic acid byproduct was produced.

Based on this pathway, a glucose dehydrogenase coenzyme regeneration system was constructed. The optimal conditions of biotransformation by the recombinant strain E-pAEAKaG were at 40 degrees C and pH 7.0. Finally, the recombinant strain E-pAEAKaG produced 3.21 +/- 0.10 g/L 2-phenylethanol in M9 medium containing 10 g/L l-phenylalanine after a 16 h transformation.

Effects of NADH kinase on NADPH-dependent biotransformation processes in Escherichia coli,"Lee, W.

In this study, construction of an efficient NADPH-regenerating system was attempted using direct phosphorylation of NADH by NADH kinase (Pos5p) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for producing guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-L-fucose and epsilon-caprolactone in recombinant Escherichia coli. Expression of Pos5p in a fed-batch culture of recombinant E. coli producing GDP-L-fucose resulted in a maximum GDP-L-fucose concentration of 291.5 mg/l, which corresponded to a 51 % enhancement compared with the control strain. In a fed-batch Baeyer-Villiger (BV) oxidation of cyclohexanone using recombinant E. coli expressing Pos5p, a maximum epsilon-caprolactone concentration of 21.6 g/l was obtained, which corresponded to a 96 % enhancement compared with the control strain. Such an increase might be due to the enhanced availability of NADPH in recombinant E. coli expressing Pos5p. These results suggested that efficient regeneration of NADPH was possible by functional expression of Pos5p in recombinant E. coli, which can be applied to other NADPH-dependent biotransformation processes in E. coli."
Tunable switch mediated shikimate biosynthesis in an engineered non-auxotrophic Escherichia coli,"Gu, P., et al.",Sci Rep,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep29745,"Shikimate is a key intermediate in the synthesis of neuraminidase inhibitors. Compared with traditional methods, microbial production of shikimate has the advantages of environmental friendliness, low cost, feed stock renewability, and product selectivity and diversity. Despite these advantages, shikimate kinase I and II respectively encoded by aroK and aroL are inactivated in most shikimate microbial producers, thus requiring the addition of aromatic compounds during the fermentation process. To overcome this problem, we constructed a non-auxotrophic, shikimate-synthesising strain of Escherichia coli. By inactivation of repressor proteins, blocking of competitive pathways and overexpression of key enzymes, we increased the shikimate production of wild-type E. coli BW25113 to 1.73 g/L. We then designed a tunable switch that can conditionally decrease gene expression and substituted it for the original aroK promoters. Expression of aroK in the resulting P-9 strain was maintained at a high level during the growth phase and then reduced at a suitable time by addition of an optimal concentration of inducer. In 5-L fed-batch fermentation, strain P-9 produced 13.15 g/L shikimate without the addition of any aromatic compounds. The tunable switch developed in this study is an efficient tool for regulating indispensable genes involved in critical metabolic pathways."
Modulation of endogenous pathways enhances bioethanol yield and productivity in Escherichia coli,"Munjal, N., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-11-145,"BACKGROUND: E. coli is a robust host for various genetic manipulations and has been used commonly for bioconversion of hexose and pentose sugars into valuable products. One of the products that E. coli make under fermentative condition is ethanol. However, availability of limited reducing equivalence and generation of competing co-products undermine ethanol yield and productivity. Here, we have constructed an E. coli strain to produce high yield of ethanol from hexose and pentose sugars by modulating the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetate kinase and by deleting pathways for competing co-products. RESULTS: The availability of reducing equivalence in E. coli was increased by inducing the expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) operon under anaerobic condition after replacement of its promoter with the promoters of ldhA, frdA, pflB, adhE and gapA. The SSY05 strain, where PDH operon was expressed under gapA promoter, demonstrated highest PDH activity and maximum improvement in ethanol yield. Deletion of genes responsible for competing products, such as lactate (ldhA), succinate (frdA), acetate (ack) and formate (pflB), led to significant reduction in growth rate under anaerobic condition. Modulation of acetate kinase expression in SSY09 strain regained cell growth rate and ethanol was produced at the maximum rate of 12 mmol/l/h from glucose. The resultant SSY09(pZSack) strain efficiently fermented xylose under microaerobic condition and produced 25 g/l ethanol at the maximum rate of 6.84 mmol/l/h with 97% of the theoretical yield. More importantly, fermentation of mixture of glucose and xylose was achieved by SSY09(pZSack) strain under microaerobic condition and ethanol was produced at the maximum rate of 0.7 g/l/h (15 mmol/l/h), respectively, with greater than 85% of theoretical yield. CONCLUSIONS: The E. coli strain SSY09(pZSack) constructed via endogenous pathway engineering fermented glucose and xylose to ethanol with high yield and productivity. This strain lacking any foreign gene for ethanol fermentation is likely to be genetically more stable and therefore should be tested further for the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysate at higher scale."
Multiple strategies for metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for efficient production of glycolate,"Zhu, T., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27934,"Glycolate is a bulk chemical with wide applications in the textile, food processing, and pharmaceutical industries. Glycolate can be produced from glucose via the glycolysis and glyoxylate shunt pathways, followed by reduction to glycolate. However, two problems limit the productivity and yield of glycolate when using glucose as the sole carbon source. The first is a cofactor imbalance in the production of glycolate from glucose via the glycolysis pathway, since NADPH is required for glycolate production, while glycolysis generates NADH. To rectify this imbalance, the NADP(+) -dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase GapC from Clostridium acetobutylicum was introduced to generate NADPH instead of NADH in the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during glycolysis. The soluble transhydrogenase SthA was further eliminated to conserve NADPH by blocking its conversion into NADH. The second problem is an unfavorable carbon flux distribution between the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate shunt. To solve this problem, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) was eliminated to increase the carbon flux of glyoxylate and thereby improve the glycolate titer. After engineering through the integration of gapC, combined with the inactivation of ICDH, SthA, and by-product pathways, as well as the upregulation of the two key enzymes isocitrate lyase (encoding by aceA), and glyoxylate reductase (encoding by ycdW), the glycolate titer increased to 5.3 g/L with a yield of 1.89 mol/mol glucose. Moreover, an optimized fed-batch fermentation reached a titer of 41 g/L with a yield of 1.87 mol/mol glucose after 60 h."
Cell-Free Mixing of Escherichia coli Crude Extracts to Prototype and Rationally Engineer High-Titer Mevalonate Synthesis,"Dudley, Q. M., et al.",ACS Synth Biol,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00154,"Cell-free metabolic engineering (CFME) is advancing a powerful paradigm for accelerating the design and synthesis of biosynthetic pathways. However, as most cell-free biomolecule synthesis systems to date use purified enzymes, energy and cofactor balance can be limiting. To address this challenge, we report a new CFME framework for building biosynthetic pathways by mixing multiple crude lysates, or extracts. In our modular approach, cell-free lysates, each selectively enriched with an overexpressed enzyme, are generated in parallel and then combinatorically mixed to construct a full biosynthetic pathway. Endogenous enzymes in the cell-free extract fuel high-level energy and cofactor regeneration. As a model, we apply our framework to synthesize mevalonate, an intermediate in isoprenoid synthesis. We use our approach to rapidly screen enzyme variants, optimize enzyme ratios, and explore cofactor landscapes for improving pathway performance. Further, we show that genomic deletions in the source strain redirect metabolic flux in resultant lysates. In an optimized system, mevalonate was synthesized at 17.6 g.L(-1) (119 mM) over 20 h, resulting in a volumetric productivity of 0.88 g.L(-1).hr(-1). We also demonstrate that this system can be lyophilized and retain biosynthesis capability. Our system catalyzes approximately 1250 turnover events for the cofactor NAD(+) and demonstrates the ability to rapidly prototype and debug enzymatic pathways in vitro for compelling metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications."
Optimization of pullulanase production in Escherichia coli by regulation of process conditions and supplement with natural osmolytes,"Duan, X., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.07.074,"In this study, the effects of temperature, IPTG (Isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) concentration, and osmolytes (proline, K-glutamate, and betaine) on cell growth and soluble pullulanase productivity of recombinant Escherichia coli were investigated. The yield of soluble pullulanase was found to be enhanced with decrease in cultivation temperature, lower IPTG concentration, and betaine supplementation in a shake flask. In addition, a modified two-stage feeding strategy was proposed and applied in a 3-L fermentor supplied with 20mM betaine, which achieved a dry cell weight of 59.3 g L(-1). Through this cultivation approach at 25 degrees C, the total soluble activity of pullulanase reached 963.9 U mL(-1), which was 8.3-fold higher than that observed without addition of betaine at 30 degrees C (115.8 U mL(-1)). The higher expression of soluble pullulanase in a scalable semisynthetic medium showed the potential of the proposed process for the industrial production of soluble enzyme."
Optimizing Fermentation Conditions of Recombinant Escherichia coli Expressing Cyclopentanone Monooxygenase,F Rudroff,Organic Process Research & Development,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/op0502654,"Microbial BaeyerâVilliger oxidation of different substrates with cyclopentanone monooxygenase (CPMO) from Comamonas NCIMB 9872 was up-scaled to benchtop fermenter scale. Conditions for cell growth and biocatalyst production were optimized, and a convenient, environmentally friendly and applicable methodology for the preparation of chiral building blocks for natural product and bioactive compound synthesis was developed by applying a resin based on the concept of in situ âsubstrate feedingâproduct removalâ (SFPR).

Photocatalytic removal of Escherichia coli from aquatic solutions using synthesized ZnO nanoparticles: a kinetic study,"Alikhani, M. Y., et al.",Water Sci Technol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2012.593,"Development of effective and low-cost disinfection technology is needed to address the problems caused by an outbreak of harmful microorganisms. In this work, an effective photocatalytic removal of Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli from aqueous solution was reported by using ZnO nanoparticles under UV light irradiation. The effect of various parameters such as solution pH, ZnO dosage, contact time and initial E. coli concentration were investigated. Maximum photocatalytic disinfection was observed at neutral pH because of the reduced photocatalytic activity of ZnO at low and high pH values originated from either acidic/photochemical corrosion of the catalyst and/or surface passivation with Zn(OH)(2). As the ZnO dosage increased, the photocatalytic disappearance of E. coli was continuously enhanced, but was gradually decreased above 2 g/L of ZnO due to the increased blockage of the incident UV light used. The optimum ZnO dosage was determined as 1 g/L. Photocatalytic removal of E. coli decreased as initial E. coli concentration increased. Three kinetic models (zero-, first- and second-order equations) were used to correlate the experimental data and to determine the kinetic parameters."
Pattern formation of bacterial colonies by escherichia coli,"R Tokita, T Katoh, Y Maeda, J Wakitaâ¦",Journal of the Physical Society of Japan,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1143/jpsj.78.074005,"We have studied the morphological diversity and change in bacterial colonies, using the bacterial species Escherichia coli, as a function of both agar concentration Ca and nutrient concentration Cn. We observed various colony patterns, classified them into four types by pattern characteristics and established a morphological diagram by dividing it into four regions. They are regions A [diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)-like], B (Eden-like), C (concentric-ring), and D (fluid-spreading). In particular, we have observed a concentric-ring colony growth for E. coli. We focused on the periodic growth in region C and obtained the following results: (i) A colony grows cyclically with the growing front repeating an advance (migration phase) and a momentary rest (consolidation phase) alternately. (ii) The growth width L and the bulge width W in one cycle decrease asymptotically to certain values, when Ca is increased. (iii) L does not depend on Cn, while W is an increasing function of Cn. Plausible mechanisms are proposed to explain the experimental results, by comparing them with those obtained for other bacterial species such as Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis."

To improve the expression level of hBD2 in Escherichia coli, tandem repeats of mature hBD2 gene were constructed and expressed as fusion proteins (TrxA-nmhBD2, n = 1, 2, 4, 8) by constructing the vectors of pET32-nsmhBD2 (n = 1, 2, 4, 8). The results showed that the tandem repeats of mhBD2 gene were highly expressed in our constructed system.

Under the optimized conditions of cultivation and isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) induction, the maximum expression level of soluble mature hBD2 (0.76 g/l) with the highest percentage of fusion protein in soluble proteins (62.2%) was obtained in the present work, which was the highest yield of hBD2 reported so far."
Systematic Engineering of Escherichia coli for d-Lactate Production from Crude Glycerol,"Wang, Z. W., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04162,"Crude glycerol resulting from biodiesel production is an abundant and renewable resource. However, the impurities in crude glycerol usually make microbial fermentation problematic. This issue was addressed by systematic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of d-lactate from crude glycerol. First, mgsA and the synthetic pathways of undesired products were eliminated in E. coli, rendering the strain capable of homofermentative production of optically pure d-lactate. To direct carbon flux toward d-lactate, the resulting strain was endowed with an enhanced expression of glpD-glpK in the glycerol catabolism and of a heterologous gene encoding d-lactate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the strain was evolved to improve its utilization of cruder glycerol and subsequently equipped with the FocA channel to export intracellular d-lactate. Finally, the fed-batch fermentation with two-phase culturing was carried out with a bioreactor. As a result, the engineered strain enabled production of 105 g/L d-lactate (99.9% optical purity) from 121 g/L crude glycerol at 40 h. The result indicates the feasibility of our approach to engineering E. coli for the crude glycerol-based fermentation."
A CRISPRi mediated self-inducible system for dynamic regulation of TCA cycle and improvement of itaconic acid production in Escherichia coli,"Zhao, M., et al.",Synth Syst Biotechnol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.synbio.2022.05.008,"Itaconic acid (ITA), an effective alternative fossil fuel, derives from the bypass pathway of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Therefore, the imbalance of metabolic flux between TCA cycle and ITA biosynthetic pathway seriously limits the production of ITA. The optimization of flux distribution between biomass and production has the potential to the productivity of ITA. Based on the previously constructed strain Escherichia coli MG1655 Delta1-SAS-3 (ITA titer: 1.87 g/L), a CRISPRi-mediated self-inducible system (CiMS), which contained a responsive module based on the ITA biosensor YpItcR/P (ccl) and a regulative CRISPRi-mediated interferential module, was developed to regulate the flux of the TCA cycle and to enhance the capacity of the strain to produce ITA. First, a higher ITA-yielding strain, Delta4-P (rmd) -SAS-3 (ITA titer: 3.20 g/L), derived from Delta1-SAS-3, was constructed by replacing the promoter P (J23100) , for the expression of ITA synthesis genes, with P (rmd) and knocking out the three bypass genes poxB, pflB, and ldhA. Subsequently, the CiMS was used to inhibit the expression of key genes icd, pykA, and sucCD to dynamically balance the metabolic flux between TCA cycle and ITA biosynthetic pathway during the ITA production stage. The constructed strain Delta4-P (rmd) -SAS-3 under the dynamic regulation of the CiMS, showed a 23% increase in the ITA titer, which reached 3.93 g/L. This study indicated that CiMS was a practical strategy to dynamically and precisely regulated the metabolic flux in microbial cell factories."

F., et al.",3 Biotech,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1332-x,"O-succinyl-l-homoserine (OSH) is a promising platform chemical for the production of C4 chemicals with huge market potential which can be produced by fermentation from glucose. To construct a strain capable of producing OSH with high yield, the metJ (encodes transcriptional repressor) and metI (encodes a subunit of dl-methionine transporter) were deleted in Escherichia coli W3110 to obtain a strain E. coli âJI. Then, overexpression of metL (encodes bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase II) and inactivation of metB (encodes cystathionine gamma-synthase) were implemented in one step, and the OSH titer of the resulting strain E. coli âJIB(*) TrcmetL was dramatically increased to 7.30 g/L. The feedback regulation was further relieved by progressively overexpressing metA(fbr) (encodes homoserine O-succinyltransferase), yjeH (encodes l-methionine exporter), and thrA(fbr) (encodes bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase I) to increase the metabolic flux from aspartate to OSH.

The culture profiles of the newly constructed strains were recorded to investigate their productive properties. The effects of l-methionine addition on the fermentation process of the optimal strain were also studied. Our results demonstrate that tuning the expression level of metL, inactivation of metB, and attenuation of feedback resistance of the crucial enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway are the key factors that impact the OSH production in E. coli."

Based on the estimated process variables by a Kalman filter, a feedforwardâfeedback controller has been implemented in order to maximize the phytase production and to minimize acetate production. The Kalman filter was used to reduce the noise of the glucose measurements and to estimate the biomass concentration, the substrate (glucose) concentration, the maximal growth rate as well as the reaction broth volume, which are used to calculate the feedforward controller contribution. A PI controller was applied to adjust the glucose concentration to the desired set point of 0.2 g/L. The secretion of phytase into the medium is increased at low glucose concentration whereas the acetate production is reduced, due to a low concentration avoiding significant overflow metabolism. The glucose concentration, as the sole measured variable used by the controller, is determined using flow injection analysis (FIA). The operation of the controller as well as its application to the E. coli cultivation is presented. The average on-line measured glucose concentration is 0.208 g/L with a standard deviation of 0.066 g/L. During the cultivation a fault occurred in the measurement system. The response of the controller system with respect to this fault is discussed in detail. Compared to a controller based on oxygen measurements, the yield of phytase is the same with the presented system."

Most previous researches have focused on the production of glutaric acid in various strains using the 5-aminovaleric acid (AMV) or pentenoic acid synthesis pathways. We previously utilized a five-step reversed adipic acid degradation pathway (RADP) in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) to construct strain Bgl146. Herein, we found that malonyl-CoA was strictly limited in this strain, and increasing its abundance could improve glutaric acid production. We, therefore, constructed a malonic acid uptake pathway in E. coli using matB (malonic acid synthetase) and matC (malonic acid carrier protein) from Clover rhizobia. The titer of glutaric acid was improved by 2.1-fold and 1.45-fold, respectively, reaching 0.56 g/L and 4.35 g/L in shake flask and batch fermentation following addition of malonic acid. Finally, the highest titer of glutaric acid was 6.3 g/L in fed-batch fermentation at optimized fermentation conditions."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli to optimize melanin synthesis from glucose,"Chavez-Bejar, M. I., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-12-108,"BACKGROUND: Natural aromatic polymers, mainly melanins, have potential and current applications in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. The biotechnological production of this class of compounds is based on tyrosinase-dependent conversion of L-tyrosine and other aromatic substrates into melanins. The purpose of this work was to apply metabolic engineering for generating Escherichia coli strains with the capacity to synthesize an aromatic polymer from a simple carbon source. RESULTS: The strategy was based on the expression in E. coli of the MutmelA gene from Rhizobium etli, encoding an improved mutant tyrosinase. To direct the carbon flow from central metabolism into the common aromatic and the L-tyrosine biosynthetic pathways, feedback inhibition resistant versions of key enzymes were expressed in strains lacking the sugar phosphotransferase system and TyrR repressor. The expressed tyrosinase consumed intracellular L-tyrosine, thus causing growth impairment in the engineered strains. To avoid this issue, a two phase production process was devised, where tyrosinase activity was controlled by the delayed addition of the cofactor Cu. Following this procedure, 3.22 g/L of melanin were produced in 120 h with glucose as carbon source. Analysis of produced melanin by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed similar characteristics to a pure eumelanin standard. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a process for producing melanin from a simple carbon source at grams level, having the potential for reducing production cost when compared to technologies employing L-tyrosine as raw material."

The plasmids with different copy numbers were used to balance the expression of the four enzymes, and the most appropriate strain (pRSF- yahK- tyrB and pCDF- gdh- Pmkdc) was identified. After determination of the optimum temperature (35 degrees C) and pH (7.5) for whole-cell catalysis, the yield of hydroxytyrosol reached 36.33 mM (5.59 g/L) and the space-time yield reached 0.70 g L(-1) h(-1)."
High-Level Production of l-Methionine by Dynamic Deregulation of Metabolism with Engineered Nonauxotroph Escherichia coli,"Niu, K., et al.",ACS Synth Biol,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00481,"l-Methionine is the only sulfur-containing amino acid among the essential amino acids, and it is mainly produced by the chemical method in industry so far. The fermentation production of l-methionine by genetically engineered strains is an attractive alternative. Due to the complex metabolic mechanism and multilevel regulation of the synthesis pathway in the organism, the fermentation production of l-methionine by genetically engineered strains was still not satisfied. In this study, the biosynthesis pathway of l-methionine was regulated based on the previous studies. As the competitive pathway and an essential amino acid for cell growth, the biosynthesis pathway of l-lysine was first repaired by complementation of the lysA gene in situ on the genome and then replaced the in situ promoter with the dynamically regulated promoter P(fliA) to construct a nonauxotroph strain. In addition, the central metabolic pathway and l-cysteine catabolism pathway were further modified to promote the cell growth and enhance the l-methionine production. Finally, the l-methionine fermentation yield in a 5 L bioreactor reached 17.74 g/L without adding exogenous amino acids. These strategies can effectively balance the contradiction between cell growth and l-methionine production and alleviate the complexity of fermentation operation and the cost with auxotroph strains, which provide a reference for the industrial production of l-methionine by microbial fermentation."

Compared to the loss of carbon flux from formate dehydrogenase (FDH), glucose dehydrogenase can produce GA while generating NAD(H). The recombinant strain Ec/pAd-pRrg boosted NADH production to 2.4 mumol/gDCW, 118% higher than with the control strain.

The lysA, metA, and thrBC genes were inactivated to block the competing and degradation pathways of L-homoserine. To enhance the carbon flux to homoserine, the effects of the lysC, thrA, and metL genes on L-homoserine production and the impact of L-homoserine on the aspartokinases (AKs) AKI, AKII, and AKIII were studied.

A crude violacein production capacity of 0.25 g L(-1) OD(600)(-1) was obtained using glucose-containing medium. By further overexpressing each of the five genes involved in violacein synthesis pathway, VioE was found as the rate-limiting step for the violacein production. The optimal strain of B8/pTRPH1-pVio-VioE was then used for fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor and a crude violacein titer of 4.45 g L(-1), as well as a productivity of 98.7 mg L(-1) h(-1), was obtained. This engineered strain showed the highest violacein titer and productivity reported so far. Our optimal strain of E. coli B8/pTRPH1-pVio-VioE by overexpression of the rate-limiting VioE in violacein synthesis pathway was a potential violacein producer by directly using glucose for industrial application."
High cell density cultivation and recombinant protein production with Escherichia coli in a rocking-motion-type bioreactor,"Glazyrina, J., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-9-42,"BACKGROUND: Single-use rocking-motion-type bag bioreactors provide advantages compared to standard stirred tank bioreactors by decreased contamination risks, reduction of cleaning and sterilization time, lower investment costs, and simple and cheaper validation. Currently, they are widely used for cell cultures although their use for small and medium scale production of recombinant proteins with microbial hosts might be very attractive. However, the utilization of rocking- or wave-induced motion-type bioreactors for fast growing aerobic microbes is limited because of their lower oxygen mass transfer rate. A conventional approach to reduce the oxygen demand of a culture is the fed-batch technology. New developments, such as the BIOSTAT CultiBag RM system pave the way for applying advanced fed-batch control strategies also in rocking-motion-type bioreactors. Alternatively, internal substrate delivery systems such as EnBase Flo provide an opportunity for adopting simple to use fed-batch-type strategies to shaken cultures. Here, we investigate the possibilities which both strategies offer in view of high cell density cultivation of E. coli and recombinant protein production. RESULTS: Cultivation of E. coli in the BIOSTAT CultiBag RM system in a conventional batch mode without control yielded an optical density (OD(600)) of 3 to 4 which is comparable to shake flasks. The culture runs into oxygen limitation. In a glucose limited fed-batch culture with an exponential feed and oxygen pulsing, the culture grew fully aerobically to an OD(600) of 60 (20 g L(-1) cell dry weight). By the use of an internal controlled glucose delivery system, EnBase Flo, OD(600) of 30 (10 g L(-1) cell dry weight) is obtained without the demand of computer controlled external nutrient supply. EnBase Flo also worked well in the CultiBag RM system with a recombinant E. coli RB791 strain expressing a heterologous alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to very high levels, indicating that the enzyme based feed supply strategy functions well for recombinant protein production also in a rocking-motion-type bioreactor. CONCLUSIONS: Rocking-motion-type bioreactors may provide an interesting alternative to standard cultivation in bioreactors for cultivation of bacteria and recombinant protein production. The BIOSTAT Cultibag RM system with the single-use sensors and advanced control system paves the way for the fed-batch technology also to rocking-motion-type bioreactors. It is possible to reach cell densities which are far above shake flasks and typical for stirred tank reactors with the improved oxygen transfer rate. For more simple applications the EnBase Flo method offers an easy and robust solution for rocking-motion-systems which do not have such advanced control possibilities."
Metabolic reprogramming and biosensor-assisted mutagenesis screening for high-level production of L-arginine in Escherichia coli,"Jiang, S., et al.",Metab Eng,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2023.02.003,"L-arginine is a value-added amino acid with promising applications in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. Further unleashing the potential of microbial cell factories to make L-arginine production more competitive remains challenging due to the sophisticated intracellular interaction networks and the insufficient knowledge of global metabolic regulation. Here, we combined multilevel rational metabolic engineering with biosensor-assisted mutagenesis screening to exploit the L-arginine production potential of Escherichia coli. First, multiple metabolic pathways were systematically reprogrammed to redirect the metabolic flux into L-arginine synthesis, including the L-arginine biosynthesis, TCA cycle, and L-arginine export. Specifically, a toggle switch responding to special cellular physiological conditions was designed to dynamically control the expression of sucA and pull more carbon flux from the TCA cycle toward L-arginine biosynthesis. Subsequently, a biosensor-assisted high-throughput screening platform was designed and applied to further exploit the L-arginine production potential. The best-engineered ARG28 strain produced 132 g/L L-arginine in a 5-L bioreactor with a yield of 0.51 g/g glucose and productivity of 2.75 g/(L â h), which were the highest values reported so far. Through whole genome sequencing and reverse engineering, Frc frameshift mutant, PqiB A78P mutant, and RpoB P564T mutant were revealed for enhancing the L-arginine biosynthesis. Our study exhibited the power of coupling rational metabolic reprogramming and biosensor-assisted mutagenesis screening to unleash the cellular potential for value-added metabolite production."

However, the current titers and productivities of heme produced by recombinant microorganisms are not high enough for a wide range of applications. In this study, the process for the fermentation of the metabolically engineered Escherichia coli HAEM7 strain was optimized for the high-level production of heme. To improve the production of heme, different carbon sources, iron concentration in the medium, pH control strategies, induction points, and iron content in the feeding solution were examined. Moreover, strategies of increasing cell density, regular iron supplementation, and supply of excess feeding solution were developed to further improve the production of heme.

Glucose uptake regulation in E. coli by the small RNA SgrS: comparative analysis of E. coli K-12 (JM109 and MG1655) and E. coli B (BL21),"Negrete, A., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-9-75,"BACKGROUND: The effect of high glucose concentration on the transcription levels of the small RNA SgrS and the messenger RNA ptsG, (encoding the glucose transporter IICBGlc), was studied in both E. coli K-12 (MG1655 and JM109) and E. coli B (BL21). It is known that the transcription level of sgrS increases when E. coli K-12 (MG1655 and JM109) is exposed to the non-metabolized glucose alpha methyl glucoside (alphaMG) or when the bacteria with a defective glycolysis pathway is grown in presence of glucose. The increased level of sRNA SgrS reduces the level of the ptsG mRNA and consequently lowers the level of the glucose transporter IICBGlc. The suggested trigger for this action is the accumulation of the corresponding phospho-sugars. RESULTS: In the course of the described work, it was found that E. coli B (BL21) and E. coli K-12 (JM109 and MG1655) responded similarly to alphaMG: both strains increased SgrS transcription and reduced ptsG transcription. However, the two strains reacted differently to high glucose concentration (40 g/L). E. coli B (BL21) reacted by increasing sgrS transcription and reducing ptsG transcription while E. coli K-12 (JM109 and MG1655) did not respond to the high glucose concentration, and, therefore, transcription of sgrS was not detected and ptsG mRNA level was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that E. coli B (BL21) tolerates high glucose concentration not only by its more efficient central carbon metabolism, but also by controlling the glucose transport into the cells regulated by the sRNA SgrS, which may suggest a way to control glucose consumption and increase its efficient utilization."
Engineering Escherichia coli for d-Allulose Production from d-Fructose by Fermentation,"Guo, Q., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05200,"d-Allulose is considered an ideal alternative to sucrose and has shown tremendous application potential in many fields. Recently, most efforts on production of d-allulose have focused on in vitro enzyme-catalyzed epimerization of cheap hexoses. Here, we proposed an approach to efficiently produce d-allulose through fermentation using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3), in which a SecY (DeltaP) channel and a d-allulose 3-epimerase (DPEase) were co-expressed, ensuring that d-fructose could be transported in its nonphosphorylated form and then converted into d-allulose by cells. Further deletion of fruA, manXYZ, mak, galE, and fruK and the use of Ni(2+) in a medium limited the carbon flux flowing into the byproduct-generating pathways and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, achieving a approximately 0.95 g/g yield of d-allulose on d-fructose using E. coli (DPEase, SecY [DeltaP], DeltaFruA, DeltaManXYZ, DeltaMak, DeltaGalE, DeltaFruK) and 8 muM Ni(2+). In fed-batch fermentation, the titer of d-allulose reached approximately 23.3 g/L."
One-step of tryptophan attenuator inactivation and promoter swapping to improve the production of L-tryptophan in Escherichia coli,"Gu, P., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-11-30,"BACKGROUND: L-tryptophan is an aromatic amino acid widely used in the food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In Escherichia coli, L-tryptophan is synthesized from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate by enzymes in the shikimate pathway and L-tryptophan branch pathway, while L-serine and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate are also involved in L-tryptophan synthesis. In order to construct a microbial strain for efficient L-tryptophan production from glucose, we developed a one step tryptophan attenuator inactivation and promoter swapping strategy for metabolic flux optimization after a base strain was obtained by overexpressing the tktA, mutated trpE and aroG genes and inactivating a series of competitive steps. RESULTS: The engineered E. coli GPT1002 with tryptophan attenuator inactivation and tryptophan operon promoter substitution exhibited 1.67 ~ 9.29 times higher transcription of tryptophan operon genes than the control GPT1001. In addition, this strain accumulated 1.70 g l(-1) L-tryptophan after 36 h batch cultivation in 300-mL shake flask. Bioreactor fermentation experiments showed that GPT1002 could produce 10.15 g l(-1) L-tryptophan in 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: The one step inactivating and promoter swapping is an efficient method for metabolic engineering. This method can also be applied in other bacteria."

Whole-cell biotransformation for large scale production of carcinine in Escherichia coli,"Zhao, M., et al.",J Biotechnol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2022.06.003,"Carcinine is a natural imidazole-containing peptide derivative. It is widely used in the cosmetics industry as anti-aging supplement with antioxidant, anti-glycation and glycation reversal functions, and it also has a notable pharmacological effect as anti-tumor drug and in protection against retinopathy. However, a technological method for synthesis and production of carcinine has not been established. In this study, a whole-cell transformation system converting beta-alanine and histamine to carcinine by the enzymes Ebony and phosphopantetheine transferase (Sfp) has been developed. The results revealed that the catalytic efficiency of the strain containing the fusion protein of Ebony and Sfp (Sfp-glycine-serine-glycine-Ebony, SGE) in Escherichia coli W3110 (WSGE strain) is significantly higher (7.45 mM) than the combinatorial strain of pET28a-ebony and pACYCDuet-sfp in E. coli BL21(DE3) (BSE strain) (2.17 mM). Under the optimal reaction conditions (25 â, pH 7.0, 12.5 g/L wet cells, 20 mM beta-alanine and 40 mM histamine), the carcinine can be quickly synthesized within 24 h up to a concentration of 22.63 mM. To achieve a continuous and efficient conversion of the precursors, a batch-feeding catalysis was designed. With this system, beta-alanine (40 mM) and histamine (40 mM) could be completely transformed to carcinine (40.34 mM) in 36 h with a productivity of 0.204 g/L h reaching a titer of 7.34 g/L. Hence, the batch-feeding whole-cell biocatalysis is a promising technology for the high yield production of carcinine which can promote the industrial production of carcinine."
Biosynthesis of adipic acid by a highly efficient induction-free system in Escherichia coli,"Zhou, Y., et al.",J Biotechnol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.03.011,"Adipic acid is an important dicarboxylic acid, which is an essential building block to synthesize nylon 6-6 fiber. Adipic acid is primarily synthesized from chemical plant, however, this process is associated with a number of environmental concerns including heavy pollution, toxic catalyst and harsh reaction conditions. A decent amount of adipic acid was produced by reconstructing the reversed adipate-degradation pathway (RADP) from Thermobifida fusca in Escherichia coli. However, IPTG was used in the previous study, which was not feasible in the fermentation industry. In this study, strong promoter-5'-UTR complexes (PUTR) were chosen to construct a highly efficient induction-free system to produce adipic acid. First, comparisons of various exogenous 5'-UTR Complexes, as well as a series of E. coli host strains, demonstrated that those genes using E. coli K12 MG1655 as the host strain produced the highest titer of adipic acid. Subsequently, optimizations were applied to enhance the titer of adipate biosynthesizing strains. The highest titer of adipate of 57.6 g L(-1) was achieved by fed-batch fermentation. This work offers a better way to enhance the industrial titer of adipate."

J., et al.",J Microbiol Biotechnol,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1105.05014,"Optimal conditions for a high cell density fermentation were investigated in a recombinant Escherichia coli producing salmosin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor. The optimized carbon and nitrogen sources were glycerol 10 g/l, yeast extract 30 g/l, and bacto-tryptone 10 g/l, yielding the dry cell weight (DCW) of 10.61 g/l in a 500 ml flask culture. The late-stage induction with 1% L-arabinose in a 5 l jar fermentor showed the highest DCW of 65.70 g/l after 27 h of the fed-batch fermentation.

Nitrogen sources impact hydrogen production by Escherichia coli using cheese whey as substrate,"Alvarado-Cuevas, Z. D., et al.",N Biotechnol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2013.03.002,"The impact of nitrogen source on hydrogen production by Escherichia coli WDHL (DeltahycADeltalacI) strain using cheese whey as a substrate was evaluated. To improve the assimilation of complex proteins such as lactalbumin, we assessed treatment with a protease. Also, five external nitrogen sources were tested: NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, urea, yeast extract, and tryptone. The treatments in 120 mL serological bottles with pancreatin 1,000 mg/L produced 1.75-fold more hydrogen than the cultures without pancreatin. In the bottle cultures supplemented with yeast extract or tryptone 5 g/L, hydrogen production increased up to 3.2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, whereas inorganic salts and urea had no statistical difference with respect to the control cultures. In 1-L bioreactors, the use of tryptone improved 2.1-fold hydrogen production. Tryptone or yeast extract enable the total consumption of lactose in 40 h, whereas in the control assay the lactose was not completely consumed. Our results demonstrate that it is necessary to select an adequate nitrogen source, which allows both carbon source consumption and high hydrogen production."
"Modification of an engineered Escherichia coli by a combinatorial strategy to improve 3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid production","Liu, Y., et al.",Biotechnol Lett,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-021-03169-z,"OBJECTIVES: 3,4-Dihydroxybutyric acid (3,4-DHBA) is a multifunctional C4 platform compound widely used for the synthesis of various materials, including pharmaceuticals. Although, a biosynthetic pathway for 3,4-DHBA production has been developed, its low yield still precludes large-scale use. Here, a heterologous four-step biosynthetic pathway was established in recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) using a combinatorial strategy. RESULTS: Several aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) were screened, using in vitro enzyme assays, to identify suitable catalysts for the dehydrogenation of 3,4-dihydroxybutanal (3,4-DHB) to 3,4-DHBA. A pathway containing glucose dehydrogenase (BsGDH) from Bacillus subtilis, D-xylonate dehydratase (YagF) from E. coli, benzoylformate decarboxylase (PpMdlC) from Pseudomonas putida and ALDH was introduced into E. coli, generating 3.04 g/L 3,4-DHBA from D-xylose (0.190 g 3,4-DHBA/g D-xylose). Disruption of competing pathways by deleting xylA, ghrA, ghrB and adhP contributed to an 87% increase in 3,4-DHBA accumulation. Expression of a fusion construct containing PpMdlC and YagF enhanced the 3,4-DHBA titer, producing the highest titer and yield reported thus far (7.71 g/L 0.482 g 3,4-DHBA/g D-xylose). CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that deleting genes from competing pathways and constructing fusion proteins significantly improved the titer and yield of 3,4-DHBA in engineered E. coli."

These permeases possess individual function for cell transportation and metabolism, and affect extracellular L-tryptophan accumulation. In this study, by knocking out three tryptophan permeases separately and simultaneously in L-tryptophan-producing strain E. coli GPT1002, we analyzed the effect of permease knock out on L-tryptophan uptake, cell growth, and L-tryptophan production. We found that TnaB is the main transporter that is responsible for the uptake of L-tryptophan. Inactivation of tnaB improved the L-tryptophan production significantly, and inactivation of aroP has an additive effect on tnaB mutant. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed that knocking out permeases affects gene transcription and cell metabolism in many metabolic pathways. The tryptophan permease-deficient GPT1017 mutant exhibited the highest L-tryptophan production at 2.79 g l(-1), which is 51.6 % higher than that produced by the control strain. In 5-l bioreactor fermentation, the L-tryptophan production in GPT1017 reached 16.3 g l(-1)."

The recombinant strain showed an increased 1.20-fold of cell growth rate and 1.24-fold of succinic acid production. Expression levels of genes related glucose uptake and succinic acid synthesis were up-regulated, and more glycerol and trehalose were accumulated.

"Organic acid toxicity, tolerance, and production in Escherichia coli biorefining applications",RT Gill,Microbial cell factories,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-4-25,"Organic acids are valuable platform chemicals for future biorefining applications. Such applications involve the conversion of low-cost renewable resources to platform sugars, which are then converted to platform chemicals by fermentation and further derivatized to large-volume chemicals through conventional catalytic routes. Organic acids are toxic to many of the microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, proposed to serve as biorefining platform hosts at concentrations well below what is required for economical production. The toxicity is two-fold including not only pH based growth inhibition but also anion-specific effects on metabolism that also affect growth. E. coli maintain viability at very low pH through several different tolerance mechanisms including but not limited to the use of decarboxylation reactions that consume protons, ion transporters that remove protons, increased expression of known stress genes, and changing membrane composition. The focus of this mini-review is on organic acid toxicity and associated tolerance mechanisms as well as several examples of successful organic acid production processes for E. coli."

The iTRAQ quantificaton of proteomics revealed 77 up-regulated proteins and 143 down-regulated proteins in E. coli THslyA. Most enzymes of glycolysis and citrate cycle pathway were weakened, while proteins associated with K4CPS synthesis were up-regulated, showing a shift of carbon flux from cell growth to K4CPS production. Further, the production of K4CPS by the recombinant strain was 1 and 2.6 g/L in a shake flask and 7-L batch bioreactor, which was 1.85- and 1.53-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain, respectively. Thus, this study provides a viable strategy for improving the production of K4CPS through a transcriptional-level manipulation."

In this study, the feasibility of using glutamate decarboxylase system to improve succinic acid production of Escherichia coli AFP111, a succinate-producing candidate with mutations in pfl, ldhA, and ptsG, under acidic conditions was investigated. By overexpressing gadBC operon in AFP111, a recombinant named as BA201 (AFP111/pMD19T-gadBC) was constructed. Fermentation at pH 5.6 showed that 30 g L(-1) glucose was consumed and 26.58 g L(-1) succinic acid was produced by BA201, which was 1.22- and 1.32-fold higher than that by the control BA200 (AFP111/pMD19T) containing the empty vector. Analysis of intracellular enzymes activities and ATP concentrations revealed that the activities of key enzymes involved in glucose uptake and products synthesis and intracellular ATP levels were all increased after overexpression of gadBC which were benefit for cell metabolism under weak acidic conditions. To further improve the succinic acid titer by recombinant BA201 at pH 5.6, the extracellular glutamate concentration was optimized and the final succinic acid titer increased 20.4% to 32.01 g L(-1). Besides, the fermentation time was prolonged by repetitive fermentation and additional 15.78 g L(-1) succinic acid was produced by recovering cells into fresh medium. The results here demonstrated a potential strategy of overexpressing gadBC for increased succinic acid production of E. coli AFP111 under weak acidic conditions."

A simple strategy to effectively produce d-lactate in crude glycerol-utilizing Escherichia coli,"Wang, Y. D., et al.",Biotechnol Biofuels,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-019-1615-4,"BACKGROUND: Fed-batch fermentation has been conventionally implemented for the production of lactic acid with a high titer and high productivity. However, its operation needs a complicated control which increases the production cost. RESULTS: This issue was addressed by simplifying the production scheme. Escherichia coli was manipulated for its glycerol dissimilation and d-lactate synthesis pathways and then subjected to adaptive evolution under high crude glycerol. Batch fermentation in the two-stage mode was performed by controlling the dissolved oxygen (DO), and the evolved strain deprived of poxB enabled production of 100 g/L d-lactate with productivity of 1.85 g/L/h. To increase productivity, the producer strain was further evolved to improve its growth rate on crude glycerol. The fermentation was performed to undergo the aerobic growth with low substrate, followed by the anaerobic production with high substrate. Moreover, the intracellular redox of the strain was balanced by fulfillment of the anaerobic respiratory chain with nitrate reduction. Without controlling the DO, the microbial fermentation resulted in the homofermentative production of d-lactate (ca. 0.97 g/g) with a titer of 115 g/L and productivity of 3.29 g/L/h. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed fermentation strategy achieves the highest yield based on crude glycerol and a comparable titer and productivity as compared to the approach by fed-batch fermentation. It holds a promise to sustain the continued development of the crude glycerol-based biorefinery."

The chosen operating parameters were: reaction temperature, initial pH of the reaction mixture and TiO2 P-25 photocatalyst loading. Escherichia coli concentration, after 90 minutes irradiation of UV-A light, was selected as the response. Twenty sets of photocatalytic disinfection experiments were conducted by adjusting operating parameters at five levels using the central composite design. Based on the experimental data, a semi-empirical expression was established and applied to predict the response. Analysis of variance revealed a strong correlation between predicted and experimental values of the response. The optimum values of the reaction temperature, initial pH of the reaction mixture and photocatalyst loading were found to be 40.3 degrees C, 5.9 g/L, and 1.0 g/L, respectively.

Despite several advantageous characteristics like fast growth and high protein yields, its inability to easily secrete recombinant proteins into the extracellular medium remains a drawback for industrial production processes. To overcome this limitation, a multitude of approaches to enhance the extracellular yield and the secretion efficiency of recombinant proteins have been developed in recent years. Here, a comprehensive overview of secretion mechanisms for recombinant proteins from E. coli is given and divided into three main sections. First, the structure of the E. coli cell envelope and the known natural secretion systems are described. Second, the use and optimization of different one- or two-step secretion systems for recombinant protein production, as well as further permeabilization methods are discussed. Finally, the often-overlooked role of cell lysis in secretion studies and its analysis are addressed. So far, effective approaches for increasing the extracellular protein concentration to more than 10 g/L and almost 100% secretion efficiency exist, however, the large range of optimization methods and their combinations suggests that the potential for secretory protein production from E. coli has not yet been fully realized."

In order to enhance l-tyrosine production in Escherichia coli, the expression of key enzymes in the shikimate pathway was up- or down-regulated. The l-tyrosine transport system and the acetic acid biosynthesis pathway were modified to further enhance l-tyrosine production. In addition, the phosphoketolase pathway was introduced in combination with cofactor engineering to redirect carbon flux to the shikimate pathway. Finally, after adaptive laboratory evolution to low pH an optimal strain was obtained. The strain can produce 92.5 g/L of l-tyrosine in a 5-L fermenter in 62 h, with a yield of 0.266 g/g glucose."

CRISPR is an effective gene editing tool, while CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is repurposed for programmable gene suppression. This study aimed to combine both CRISPR and CRISPRi for metabolic engineering of E. coli and 1,4-BDO production. We first exploited CRISPR to perform point mutation of gltA, replacement of native lpdA with heterologous lpdA, knockout of sad and knock-in of two large (6.0 and 6.3 kb in length) gene cassettes encoding the six genes (cat1, sucD, 4hbd, cat2, bld, bdh) in the 1,4-BDO biosynthesis pathway. The successive E. coli engineering enabled production of 1,4-BDO to a titer of 0.9 g/L in 48 h. By combining the CRISPRi system to simultaneously suppress competing genes that divert the flux from the 1,4-BDO biosynthesis pathway (gabD, ybgC and tesB) for >85%, we further enhanced the 1,4-BDO titer for 100% to 1.8 g/L while reducing the titers of byproducts gamma-butyrolactone and succinate for 55% and 83%, respectively. These data demonstrate the potential of combining CRISPR and CRISPRi for genome engineering and metabolic flux regulation in microorganisms such as E. coli and production of chemicals (e.g., 1,4-BDO)."

E. coli KJ12201 (KJ122::DeltaxylFGH) exhibited superior abilities in growth, xylose consumption, and succinate production compared to those of the parental strain KJ122. However, E. coli KJ12202 (KJ122::DeltaxylE) lessened xylose consumption due to an ATP deficit for metabolizing xylose thus making succinate production from xylose not preferable. Moreover, E. coli KJ12203 (KJ122::DeltaxylFGHDeltaxylE) exhibited an impaired growth on xylose due to lacking of xylose transporters. After performing metabolic evolution, the evolved KJ12201-14T strain exhibited a great improvement in succinate production from pure xylose with higher concentration and productivity about 18 and 21%, respectively, compared to KJ12201 strain. During fed-batch fermentation, KJ12201-14T also produced succinate from xylose at a concentration, yield, and overall productivity of 84.6 +/- 0.7 g/L, 0.86 +/- 0.01 g/g and 1.01 +/- 0.01 g/L/h, respectively. KJ12201 and KJ12201-14T strains co-utilized glucose/xylose mixture without catabolite repression. Both strains produced succinate from glucose/xylose mixture at concentration, yield, and overall and specific productivities of about 85 g/L, 0.85 g/g, 0.70 g/L/h, and 0.44 g/gCDW/h, respectively. Based on our results, KJ12201 and KJ12201-14T strains exhibited a greater performance in succinate production from xylose containing medium than those of other published works. They would be potential strains for the economic bio-based succinate production from xylose."
Enhancing fatty acid production in Escherichia coli by Vitreoscilla hemoglobin overexpression,"Liu, D., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.26067,"Our recent (13) C-metabolic flux analysis ((13) C-MFA) study indicates that energy metabolism becomes a rate-limiting factor for fatty acid overproduction in E. coli strains (after Push-Pull-Block based genetic modifications). To resolve this bottleneck, Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb, a membrane protein facilitating O(2) transport) was introduced into a fatty-acid-producing strain to promote oxygen supply and energy metabolism. The resulting strain, FAV50, achieved 70% percent higher fatty acid titer than the parent strain in micro-aerobic shake tube cultures. In high cell-density bioreactor fermentations, FAV50 achieved free fatty acids at a titer of 7.02 g/L (51% of the theoretical yield). In addition to Push-Pull-Block-Power strategies, our experiments and flux balance analysis also revealed the fatty acid over-producing strain is sensitive to metabolic burden and oxygen influx, and thus a careful evaluation of the cost-benefit tradeoff with the guidance of fluxome analysis will be fundamental for the rational design of synthetic biology strains.

Efficient free fatty acid production from woody biomass hydrolysate using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Wu, H., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.06.092,"Four engineered Escherichia coli strains, ML103(pXZ18), ML103(pXZ18Z), ML190(pXZ18) and ML190(pXZ18Z), were constructed to investigate free fatty acid production using hydrolysate as carbon source. These strains exhibited efficient fatty acid production when xylose was used as the sole carbon source. For mixed sugars, ML103 based strains utilized glucose and xylose sequentially under the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) regulation, while ML190 based strains, with ptsG mutation, used glucose and xylose simultaneously. The total free fatty acid concentration and yield of the strain ML190(pXZ18Z) based on the mixed sugar reached 3.64 g/L and 24.88%, respectively. Furthermore, when hydrolysate from a commercial plant was used as the carbon source, the strain ML190(pXZ18Z) can produce 3.79 g/L FFAs with a high yield of 21.42%."
"Engineering microaerobic metabolism of E. coli for 1,2-propanediol production","Jain, R., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-015-1622-9,"Establishment of novel metabolic pathways for biosynthesis of chemicals, fuels and pharmaceuticals has been demonstrated in Escherichia coli due to its ease of genetic manipulation and adaptability to varying oxygen levels. E. coli growing under microaerobic condition is known to exhibit features of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. In this work, we attempt to engineer this metabolism for production of 1,2-propanediol. We first redirect the carbon flux by disrupting carbon-competing pathways to increase the production of 1,2-propanediol microaerobically from 0.25 to 0.85 g/L. We then disrupt the first committed step of E. coli's ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway (ubiC) to prevent the oxidation of NADH in microaerobic conditions. Coupling this strategy with carbon flux redirection leads to enhanced production of 1,2-propanediol at 1.2 g/L. This work demonstrates the production of non-native reduced chemicals in E. coli by engineering its microaerobic metabolism."

H., et al.",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-019-03178-9,"5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an important metabolic intermediate compound with high value and has recently been used in agriculture and medicine. In this study, we have constructed six recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains that are involved in pET system under the regulation of the T7 promoter and LacI to express codon-optimized hemA gene from Rhodobacter capsulatus (RchemA) for ALA production via the C4 pathway. Due to codon optimization, hemA has a high transcriptional level however, most RcHemA proteins were formed as inclusion body. To improve expression in soluble form, the vector with TrxA fusion tag was successfully used and co-expressed with partner GroELS as chaperone in another vector. As a result, ALA production increased significantly from 1.21 to 3.67 g/L. In addition, optimal ALA production was developed through adjustment of induction time and isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentration, as well as substrate addition conditions. By adopting a two-stage induction strategy, the highest ALA reached 5.66 g/L when 0.1 mM of IPTG was added at early exponential phase (i.e., OD(600) was equal to 0.7 to 0.8), while 6 g/L of glycine, 2 g/L of succinate, and 0.03 mM of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) were provided in the mid-exponential phase in fermentation."

First, the predicted structure of SDH was obtained using AlphaFold2. The key mutation sites in the substrate pocket were identified by Ala scanning. Subsequently, the mutant V336I/V368A was obtained by iterative saturation mutagenesis, which increased the yield of 2-KLG 1.9-fold. Finally, 5.03 g/L of 2-KLG was obtained by a two-stage temperature control fermentation method, and the conversion rate was 50%.

Lee",J Microbiol Biotechnol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1308.08082,"Biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) via the indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway involves three kinds of enzymes aminotransferase encoded by aspC, indole-3-pyruvic acid decarboxylase encoded by ipdC, and indole-3-acetic acid dehydrogenase encoded by iad1. The ipdC from Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, aspC from Escherichia coli, and iad1 from Ustilago maydis were cloned and expressed under the control of the tac and sod promoters in E. coli. According to SDS-PAGE and enzyme activity, IpdC and Iad1 showed good expression under the control of P(tac), whereas AspC was efficiently expressed by P(sod) originating from Corynebacterium glutamicum. The activities of IpdC, AspC, and Iad1 from the crude extracts of recombinant E. coli Top 10 were 215.6, 5.7, and 272.1 nmol/min/mg-protein, respectively.

To improve IAA production, a tnaA gene mediating indole formation from tryptophan was deleted. As a result, E. coli IAA68 with expression of the three genes produced 1.8 g/l of IAA, which is a 1.6- fold increase compared with wild-type DH5alpha harboring the same plasmids. Moreover, the complete conversion of tryptophan to IAA was achieved by E. coli IAA68. Finally, E. coli IAA68 produced 3.0 g/l of IAA after 24 h cultivation in LB medium supplemented with 4 g/l of tryptophan."

The protein sequence alignment of PHB synthases revealed that phaC (Cma) shares at least 60% identity with those of class I PHB synthase. The effects of PhaA, PhaB, and PhaC expression levels on PHB production were investigated. While the overexpression of PhaB is found to be important in recombinant E. coli, performances of PHB production can be quantified as follows: PHB concentration of 16.8 +/- 0.6 g/L, yield of 0.28 g/g glucose, content of 74%, productivity of 0.28 g/L/h, and Mw of 1.41 MDa."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the utilization of ethanol,"Cao, Y., et al.",J Biol Res (Thessalon),2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40709-020-0111-0,"BACKGROUND: The fuel ethanol industry has made tremendous progress in the last decades. Ethanol can be obtained by fermentation using a variety of biomass materials as the feedstocks. However, few studies have been conducted on ethanol utilization by microorganisms. The price of petroleum-derived ethanol, easily made by the hydrolysis of ethylene, is even lower than that of bioethanol. If ethanol can be metabolized by microorganisms to produce value-added chemicals, it will open a new door for the utilization of inexpensive ethanol resources. RESULTS: We constructed an engineered Escherichia coli strain which could utilize ethanol as the sole carbon source. The alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase from Aspergillus nidulans was introduced into E. coli and the recombinant strain acquired the ability to grow on ethanol. Cell growth continued when ethanol was supplied after glucose starvation and 2.24 g L(-1) of ethanol was further consumed during the shake-flasks fermentation process. Then ethanol was further used for the production of mevalonic acid by heterologously expressing its biosynthetic pathway. Deuterium-labeled ethanol-D6 as the feedstock confirmed that mevalonic acid was synthesized from ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the possibility of using ethanol as the carbon source by engineered E. coli strains. It can serve as the basis for the construction of more robust strains in the future though the catabolic capacity of ethanol should be further improved."
Spontaneous liberation of intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate granules in Escherichia coli,"Jung, I. L., et al.",Res Microbiol,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2005.04.004,"Despite receiving much attention as a biodegradable substitute for conventional non-biodegradable plastics, the commercial use of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) remains limited because of its high production cost. In order to reduce the recovery/purification cost, which forms over half of the total production cost, we have developed a new cultivation method which enables spontaneous liberation of PHB by modulation of the initial inoculum size and the medium composition in recombinant Escherichia coli harboring Alcaligenes eutrophus phbCAB genes. In flask cultivation using a low cell inoculum and 2x LB medium containing 21% glucose, autolysis of 80.2% as well as yields of 85.2 g/l of PHB and a PHB content of 99.0% (w/w) were obtained. The glucose conversion rate was 0.43. The strategies developed in this study can minimize complex and unfavorable efforts required for efficient recovery/purification processes, thereby enabling biodegradable plastic to be produced by the recombinant E. coli so as to compete with conventional non-biodegradable plastic."
Genetically Engineering Escherichia coli to Produce Xylitol from Corncob Hydrolysate without Lime Detoxification,"Yuan, X., et al.",Molecules,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28041550,"Before fermentation with hemicellulosic hydrolysate as a substrate, it is generally necessary to detoxify the toxic substances that are harmful to microorganism growth. Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a global regulator, and mutation of its key sites may have an important impact on E. coli virulence tolerance. Using corncob hydrolysate without ion-exchange or lime detoxification as the substrate, shake flask fermentation experiments showed that CRP mutant IS5-dG (I112L, T127G, A144T) produced 18.4 g/L of xylitol within 34 h, and the OD(600) was 9.7 at 24 h these values were 41.5% and 21.3% higher than those of the starting strain, IS5-d, respectively. This mutant produced 82 g/L of xylitol from corncob hydrolysate without ion-exchange or lime detoxification during fed-batch fermentation in a 15-L bioreactor, with a productivity of 1.04 g/L/h these values were 173% and 174% higher than the starting strain, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the highest xylitol concentration and productivity produced by microbial fermentation using completely non-detoxified hemicellulosic hydrolysate as the substrate to date. This study also showed that alkali neutralization, high temperature sterilization, and fermentation of the hydrolysate had important effects on the xylose loss rate and xylitol production."
Escherichia coli high-cell-density culture: carbon mass balances and release of outer membrane components,"Han, L., et al.",Bioprocess Biosyst Eng,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00449-002-0300-2,"Carbon mass balances were calculated in fed-batch cultures of E. coli W3110, using mineral medium with glucose as the limiting substrate. The carbon recovery, based on biomass, CO(2), and acetate was approximately 90% at the end of the culture (25 h, 27 g L(-1) dw). The missing carbon remained as soluble organic compounds in the medium. Outer membrane (OM) constituents, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), phospholipids (PL), and carbohydrates (each at approximately 1 g L(-1)) contributed to 63% of the extracellular carbon. The amount of released LPS and PL equaled the total amount of OM bound to the cells in the culture. Small amounts of DNA and protein detected in the medium indicated that no cell lysis had occurred. Acetate, lactate, ethanol, formate, succinate and amino acids (Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn, Ala, Gly, Ser) were detected in the culture medium, but made up only a few percent of the extracellular carbon mass. The remaining 30% was not identified, but was assumed to constitute complex carbohydrates."

Thus, it would be advantageous to develop an alternative source of heparosan from a non-pathogeneic strain. In this work we reported the biosynthesis of heparosan via the metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic E. coli BL21 as a production host. Four genes, KfiA, KfiB, KfiC and KfiD, encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of heparosan in E. coli K5, were cloned into inducible plasmids pETDuet-1 and pRSFDuet-1 and further transformed into E. coli BL21, yielding six recombinant strains as follows: sA, sC, sAC, sABC, sACD and sABCD. The single expression of KfiA (sA) or KfiC (sC) in E. coli BL21 did not produce heparosan, while the co-expression of KfiA and KfiC (sAC) could produce 63 mg/L heparosan in shake flask. The strain sABC and sACD could produce 100 and 120 mg/L heparosan, respectively, indicating that the expression of KfiB or KfiD was beneficial for heparosan production. The strain sABCD could produce 334 mg/L heparosan in shake flask and 652 mg/L heparosan in 3-L batch bioreactor. The heparosan yield was further increased to 1.88 g/L in a dissolved oxygen-stat fed-batch culture in 3-L bioreactor. As revealed by the nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, the chemical structure of heparosan from recombinant E. coli BL21 and E. coli K5 was identical. The weight average molecular weight of heparosan from E. coli K5, sAC, sABC, sACD, and sABCD was 51.67, 39.63, 91.47, 64.51, and 118.30 kDa, respectively. This work provides a viable process for the production of heparosan as a precursor of bioengineered heparin from a safer bacteria strain."

Engineering Escherichia coli for high-level production of propionate,"Akawi, L., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-015-1627-4,"Mounting environmental concerns associated with the use of petroleum-based chemical manufacturing practices has generated significant interest in the development of biological alternatives for the production of propionate. However, biological platforms for propionate production have been limited to strict anaerobes, such as Propionibacteria and select Clostridia. In this work, we demonstrated high-level heterologous production of propionate under microaerobic conditions in engineered Escherichia coli. Activation of the native Sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm) operon not only transformed E. coli to be propionogenic (i.e., propionate-producing) but also introduced an intracellular flux competition between the traditional C2-fermentative pathway and the novel C3-fermentative pathway. Dissimilation of the major carbon source of glycerol was identified to critically affect such flux competition and, therefore, propionate synthesis. As a result, the propionogenic E. coli was further engineered by inactivation or overexpression of various genes involved in the glycerol dissimilation pathways and their individual genetic effects on propionate production were investigated. Generally, knocking out genes involved in glycerol dissimilation (except glpA) can minimize levels of solventogenesis and shift more dissimilated carbon flux toward the C3-fermentative pathway. For optimal propionate production with high C3:C2-fermentative product ratios, glycerol dissimilation should be channeled through the respiratory pathway and, upon suppressed solventogenesis with minimal production of highly reduced alcohols, the alternative NADH-consuming route associated with propionate synthesis can be critical for more flexible redox balancing. With the implementation of various biochemical and genetic strategies, high propionate titers of more than 11 g/L with high yields up to 0.4 g-propionate/g-glycerol (accounting for ~50 % of dissimilated glycerol) were achieved, demonstrating the potential for industrial application. To our knowledge, this represents the most effective engineered microbial system for propionate production with titers and yields comparable to those achieved by anaerobic batch cultivation of various native propionate-producing strains of Propionibacteria."
Production of FAME biodiesel in E. coli by direct methylation with an insect enzyme,"Sherkhanov, S., et al.",Sci Rep,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24239,"Most biodiesel currently in use consists of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) produced by transesterification of plant oils with methanol. To reduce competition with food supplies, it would be desirable to directly produce biodiesel in microorganisms. To date, the most effective pathway for the production of biodiesel in bacteria yields fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) at up to ~1.5 g/L. A much simpler route to biodiesel produces FAMEs by direct S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) dependent methylation of free fatty acids, but FAME production by this route has been limited to only ~16 mg/L. Here we employ an alternative, broad spectrum methyltransferase, Drosophila melanogaster Juvenile Hormone Acid O-Methyltransferase (DmJHAMT). By introducing DmJHAMT in E. coli engineered to produce medium chain fatty acids and overproduce SAM, we obtain medium chain FAMEs at titers of 0.56 g/L, a 35-fold increase over titers previously achieved. Although considerable improvements will be needed for viable bacterial production of FAMEs and FAEEs for biofuels, it may be easier to optimize and transport the FAME production pathway to other microorganisms because it involves fewer enzymes."

Thus, we selected this enzyme for pipecolic acid biosynthesis in a whole-cell bioconversion. To construct a robust pipecolic acid production system, we investigated important conditions including expression vector, strain, culture conditions, and other reaction parameters. The most important factor was the introduction of multiple pipA genes into the whole-cell system. As a result, we produced 724 mM pipecolic acid (72.4 % conversion), and the productivity was 0.78 g/L/h from 1 M l-lysine after 5 days. This is the highest production reported to date."

In this study, we attempted to improve production of fructosylated chondroitin in Escherichia coli K4 by balancing intracellular levels of the precursors UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcA. To this end, we deleted pfkA to favor the production of Fru-6-P. Then, we identified rate-limiting enzymes in the synthesis of UDP-precursors. Third, UDP-GalNAc synthesis, UDP-GlcA synthesis, and chondroitin polymerization were combinatorially optimized by altering the expression of relevant enzymes. The ratio of intracellular UDP-GalNAc to UDP-GlcA increased from 0.17 in the wild-type strain to 1.05 in a 30-L fed-batch culture of the engineered strain. Titer and productivity of fructosylated chondroitin also increased to 8.43â¯g/L and 227.84â¯mg/L/h the latter represented the highest productivity level achieved to date."
Mutation in galP improved fermentation of mixed sugars to succinate using engineered Escherichia coli AS1600a and AM1 mineral salts medium,"Sawisit, A., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.06.108,"Escherichia coli KJ122 was engineered to produce succinate from glucose using the wild type GalP for glucose uptake instead of the native phosphotransferase system (ptsI mutation). This strain now ferments 10% xylose poorly. Mutants were selected by serial transfers in AM1 mineral salts medium with 10% xylose. Clones from this population all exhibited a similar improvement, co-fermentation of an equal mixture of xylose and glucose. One of these, AS1600a, produced 84.26 +/- 1.37 g/L succinate, equivalent to that produced by the parent (KJ122) from 10% glucose (85.46 +/- 1.78 g/L). AS1600a was sequenced and found to contain a mutation in galactose permease (GalP, G236D). This mutation was shown to be responsible for the improvement in fermentation using KJDeltagalP as the host and expression vectors with native galP and with mutant galP( *). Strain AS1600a and KJDeltagalP(pLOI5746 galP( *)) also co-fermented a mixture of glucose, xylose, arabinose, and galactose in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate using mineral salts medium."
Awakening the natural capability of psicose production in Escherichia coli,"Taylor, J. E., et al.",NPJ Sci Food,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-023-00231-0,"Due to the rampant rise in obesity and diabetes, consumers are desperately seeking for ways to reduce their sugar intake, but to date there are no options that are both accessible and without sacrifice of palatability. One of the most promising new ingredients in the food system as a non-nutritive sugar substitute with near perfect palatability is D-psicose. D-psicose is currently produced using an in vitro enzymatic isomerization of D-fructose, resulting in low yield and purity, and therefore requiring substantial downstream processing to obtain a high purity product. This has made adoption of D-psicose into products limited and results in significantly higher per unit costs, reducing accessibility to those most in need. Here, we found that Escherichia coli natively possesses a thermodynamically favorable pathway to produce D-psicose from D-glucose through a series of phosphorylation-epimerization-dephosphorylation steps. To increase carbon flux towards D-psicose production, we introduced a series of genetic modifications to pathway enzymes, central carbon metabolism, and competing metabolic pathways. In an attempt to maximize both cellular viability and D-psicose production, we implemented methods for the dynamic regulation of key genes including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats inhibition (CRISPRi) and stationary-phase promoters. The engineered strains achieved complete consumption of D-glucose and production of D-psicose, at a titer of 15.3 g L(-1), productivity of 2 g L(-1) h(-1), and yield of 62% under test tube conditions. These results demonstrate the viability of whole-cell catalysis as a sustainable alternative to in vitro enzymatic synthesis for the accessible production of D-psicose."
High-efficient production of L-homoserine in Escherichia coli through engineering synthetic pathway combined with regulating cell division,"Liu, Z., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2023.129828,"L-Homoserine is an important amino acid as a precursor in synthesizing many valuable products. However, the low productivity caused by slow L-homoserine production during active cell growth in fermentation hinders its potential applications. In this study, strategies of engineering the synthetic pathway combined with regulating cell division were employed in an L-homoserine-producing Escherichia coli strain for efficiently biomanufacturing L-homoserine. First, the flux-control genes in the L-homoserine degradation pathway were omitted to redistribute carbon flux. To drive more carbon flux into L-homoserine production, the phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate-oxaloacetate loop was redrawn. Subsequently, the cell division was engineered by using the self-regulated promoters to coordinate cell growth and L-homoserine production. The ultimate strain HOM23 produced 101.31 g/L L-homoserine with a productivity of 1.91 g/L/h, which presented the highest L-homoserine titer and productivity to date from plasmid-free strains. The strategies used in this study could be applied to constructing cell factories for producing other L-aspartate derivatives."
Highly efficient L-lactate production using engineered Escherichia coli with dissimilar temperature optima for L-lactate formation and cell growth,"Niu, D., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-13-78,"L-Lactic acid, one of the most important chiral molecules and organic acids, is produced via pyruvate from carbohydrates in diverse microorganisms catalyzed by an NAD+-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase. Naturally, Escherichia coli does not produce L-lactate in noticeable amounts, but can catabolize it via a dehydrogenation reaction mediated by an FMN-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase. In aims to make the E. coli strain to produce L-lactate, three L-lactate dehydrogenase genes from different bacteria were cloned and expressed. The L-lactate producing strains, 090B1 (B0013-070, DeltaldhA::diflldD::Pldh-ldhLca), 090B2 (B0013-070, DeltaldhA::diflldD::Pldh-ldhStrb) and 090B3 (B0013-070, DeltaldhA::diflldD::Pldh-ldhBcoa) were developed from a previously developed D-lactate over-producing strain, E. coli strain B0013-070 (ack-ptappspflBdldpoxBadhEfrdA) by: (1) deleting ldhA to block D-lactate formation, (2) deleting lldD to block the conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate, and (3) expressing an L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) to convert pyruvate to L-lactate under the control of the ldhA promoter. Fermentation tests were carried out in a shaking flask and in a 25-l bioreactor. Strains 090B1, 090B2 or 090B3 were shown to metabolize glucose to L-lactate instead of D-lactate. However, L-lactate yield and cell growth rates were significantly different among the metabolically engineered strains which can be attributed to a variation between temperature optimum for cell growth and temperature optimum for enzymatic activity of individual L-LDH. In a temperature-shifting fermentation process (cells grown at 37 degrees C and L-lactate formed at 42 degrees C), E. coli 090B3 was able to produce 142.2 g/l of L-lactate with no more than 1.2 g/l of by-products (mainly acetate, pyruvate and succinate) accumulated. In conclusion, the production of lactate by E. coli is limited by the competition relationship between cell growth and lactate synthesis. Enzymatic properties, especially the thermodynamics of an L-LDH can be effectively used as a factor to regulate a metabolic pathway and its metabolic flux for efficient L-lactate production. HIGHLIGHTS: The enzymatic thermodynamics was used as a tool for metabolic regulation. Minimizing the activity of L-lactate dehydrogenase in growth phase improved biomass accumulation. Maximizing the activity of L-lactate dehydrogenase improved lactate productivity in production phase."
Constructing a Novel Biosynthetic Pathway for the Production of Glycolate from Glycerol in Escherichia coli,"Zhan, T., et al.",ACS Synth Biol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00404,"Glycolate is an important alpha-hydroxy acid with a wide range of industrial applications. The current industrial production of glycolate mainly depends on chemical synthesis, but biochemical production from renewable resources using engineered microorganisms is increasingly viewed as an attractive alternative. Crude glycerol is an abundant byproduct of biodiesel production and a widely investigated potential sustainable feedstock. Here, we constructed a novel biosynthetic pathway for the production of glycolate from glycerol in Escherichia coli. The pathway starts from the oxidation of glycerol to d-glycerate by alditol oxidase, followed by sequential enzymatic dehydrogenation and decarboxylation as well as reduction reactions. We screened and characterized the catalytic activity of candidate enzymes, and a variant of alditol oxidase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), 2-hydroxyglutarate-pyruvate transhydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase from Lactococcus lactis, and aldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli were selected and assembled to create an artificial operon for the biosynthetic production of glycolate from glycerol. We also characterized the native strong constitutive promoter P(lpp) from E. coli and compared it with the P(T7) promoter, which was employed to express the artificial operon on the plasmid pSC105-ADKA. To redirect glycerol flux toward glycolate synthesis, we deleted key genes of the native glycerol assimilation pathways and other branches of native E. coli metabolism, and we introduced a second plasmid expressing Dld3 to reduce the accumulation of the intermediate d-glycerate. Finally, the engineered strain TZ-108 harboring pSC105-ADKA and pACYC184-P(lpp)-Dld3 produced 0.64 g/L glycolate in shake flasks, which was increased to 4.74 g/L in fed-batch fermentation. This study provides an alternative pathway for glycolate synthesis and demonstrates the potential for producing other commodity chemicals by redesigning glycerol metabolism."
"Integrated gene engineering synergistically improved substrate-product transport, cofactor generation and gene translation for cadaverine biosynthesis in E. coli","Osire, T., et al.",Int J Biol Macromol,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.017,"Several approaches for efficient production of cadaverine, a bio-based diamine with broad industrial applications have been explored. Here, Serratia marcescens lysine decarboxylase (SmcadA) was expressed in E. coli mild surfactants added in biotransformation reactions the E. coli native lysine/cadaverine antiporter cadB, E. coli pyridoxal kinases pdxK and pdxY overexpressed and synthetic RBS libraries screened. Addition of mild surfactants and overexpression of antiporter cadB increased cadaverine biosynthesis of SmcadA. Moreover, expression of pdxY gene yielded 19.82 g/L in a reaction mixture containing added cofactor precursor pyridoxal (PL), without adding exogenous PLP. The screened synthetic RBS1, applied to fully exploit pdxY gene expression, ultimately resulted in PLP self-sufficiency, producing 27.02 g/L cadaverine using strain T7R1_PL. To boost SmcadA catalytic activity, the designed mutants Arg595Lys and Ser512Ala had significantly improved cumulative cadaverine production of 219.54 and 201.79 g/L respectively compared to the wild-type WT (181.62 g/L), after 20 h reaction. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations for WT and variants indicated that increased flexibility at the binding sites of the protein enhanced residue-ligand interactions, contributing to high cadaverine synthesis. This work demonstrates potential of harnessing different pull factors through integrated gene engineering of efficient biocatalysts and gaining insight into the mechanisms involved through MD simulations."
Production of itaconic acid using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Okamoto, S., et al.",J Gen Appl Microbiol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.2323/jgam.60.191,"An Escherichia coli system was engineered for the heterologous production of itaconic acid via the expression of cis-aconitate decarboxylase gene (cad), and then maximal itaconic acid levels produced by engineered E. coli were evaluated. Expression of cad in E. coli grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium without glucose in a test tube resulted in 0.07 g/L itaconic acid production after 78 h at 20 degrees C. To increase itaconic acid production, E. coli recombinants were constructed by inactivating the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (icd) and/or the isocitrate lyase gene (aceA). Expression of cad and inactivation of icd resulted in 0.35 g/L itaconic acid production after 78 h, whereas aceA inactivation had no effect on itaconic acid production. The intracellular itaconate concentration in the Deltaicd strain was higher than that in the cad-expressing strain without icd inactivation, which suggests that the extracellular secretion of itaconate in E. coli is the rate-determining step during itaconic acid production. pH-stat cultivation using the cad-expressing Deltaicd strain in LB medium with 3% glucose in a jar fermenter resulted in 1.71 g/L itaconic acid production after 97 h at 28 degrees C. To further increase itaconic acid production, the aconitase B gene (acnB) was overexpressed in the cad-expressing Deltaicd strain. Simultaneous overexpression of acnB with the expression of cad in the Deltaicd strain led to 4.34 g/L itaconic acid production after 105 h. Our findings indicate that icd inactivation and acnB overexpression considerably enhance itaconic acid production in cad-expressing E. coli."
Effect of stress on production of heat labile enterotoxin by Escherichia coli,"Hegde, A., et al.",Indian J Med Microbiol,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.4103/0255-0857.55446,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important pathogen responsible for secretory diarrhoea. The production of heat labile enterotoxin (LT), by ETEC, is largely responsible for the pathogenesis of diarrhoea. In the present study we investigated the effect of stress factors such as temperature, pH, osmotic stress and nutritional limitation on the production of LT by ETEC using in-house GMI-ELISA. Four strains of E. coli consisting, one standard strain MTCC 723 and three clinical isolates were used in the study. Maximum amount of LT (OD 3.285) was produced at 37 0 C followed by 40 0 C (OD 3.305). Growth of E. coli in medium with pH 8.6 resulted in maximum amount of LT production (OD 3.489). LT was not detectable when bacteria were grown in medium with pH < or =7.2 and > or = 9.2. Sodium chloride concentration of 0.2 M stimulated maximum amount of LT production. Maximum amount of LT was produced when the bacteria were grown in medium containing 2.5 g/l of glucose. All the stress factors had a significant effect on the LT production by E. coli , though quantitative differences in the various strains were observed."
Detection of catechol using an electrochemical biosensor based on engineered Escherichia coli cells that surface-display laccase,"Zhang, Z., et al.",Anal Chim Acta,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2018.01.008,"In this study, we report an electrochemical microbial biosensor that was made by immobilizing a bacterial laccase on the surface of Escherichia coli cells followed by adsorption of modified live cells onto a glassy-carbon electrode. Expression and surface localization of laccase on target cells were confirmed by Western blotting, flow cytometry assays and immunofluorescence microscopy observation. Increased tandem-aligned anchors with three repeats of the N-terminal domain of an ice nucleation protein were used to construct a highly active E. coli whole cell laccase-based catalytic system. When the proposed biosensor was used to detect catechol, the electrochemical response under optimized pH conditions was linear within a concentration range of 0.5â¯muM-300.0â¯muM catechol. Metal ions (Mn(2+), Fe(3+), Cu(2+), Mg(2+), Al(3+) and Zn(2+)) at concentrations from 1 to 10â¯mgâ¯L(-1), bovine serum albumin and glucose at concentrations from 0.1 to 10â¯gâ¯L(-1), and ascorbic acid at concentrations from 0.01 to 0.1â¯gâ¯L(-1) did not cause a noticeable interference effect. The detection limit of 0.1â¯muM catechol was comparable to those of other biosensors based on purified chemically modified laccases. When used to detect catechol in real red wine and tea samples, the biosensor offered a considerable level of accuracy comparable to the HPLC method as well as high recovery rates (98.2%-103.8%) towards all of the tested samples. Moreover, the developed system also exhibited high stability and reproducibility."

The traditional GABA process involves the decarboxylation of glutamate. However, the direct production of GABA from glucose is a more efficient process. To construct the recombinant strains of Escherichia coli, a novel synthetic scaffold was introduced. By carrying out the co-localization of glutamate synthase, glutamate decarboxylase, and GABA transporter, we redirected the TCA cycle flux to GABA pathway. The genetically engineered E. coli strain produced 1.08 g/L of GABA from 10 g/L of initial glucose. Thus, with the introduction of a synthetic scaffold, we increased GABA production by 2.2-fold. The final GABA concentration was increased by 21.8% by inactivating competing pathways."
"Engineering Escherichia coli for highly efficient production of lacto-N-triose II from N-acetylglucosamine, the monomer of chitin","Hu, D., et al.",Biotechnol Biofuels,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-021-02050-5,"BACKGROUND: Lacto-N-triose II (LNT II), an important backbone for the synthesis of different human milk oligosaccharides, such as lacto-N-neotetraose and lacto-N-tetraose, has recently received significant attention. The production of LNT II from renewable carbon sources has attracted worldwide attention from the perspective of sustainable development and green environmental protection. RESULTS: In this study, we first constructed an engineered E. coli cell factory for producing LNT II from N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) feedstock, a monomer of chitin, by introducing heterologous beta-1,3-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, resulting in a LNT II titer of 0.12 g L(-1). Then, lacZ (lactose hydrolysis) and nanE (GlcNAc-6-P epimerization to ManNAc-6-P) were inactivated to further strengthen the synthesis of LNT II, and the titer of LNT II was increased to 0.41 g L(-1). To increase the supply of UDP-GlcNAc, a precursor of LNT II, related pathway enzymes including GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase, glucosamine synthase, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase, were overexpressed in combination, optimized, and modulated. Finally, a maximum titer of 15.8 g L(-1) of LNT II was obtained in a 3-L bioreactor with optimal enzyme expression levels and beta-lactose and GlcNAc feeding strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic engineering of E. coli is an effective strategy for LNT II production from GlcNAc feedstock. The titer of LNT II could be significantly increased by modulating the gene expression strength and blocking the bypass pathway, providing a new utilization for GlcNAc to produce high value-added products."
Modular Engineering of l-Tyrosine Production in Escherichia coli,EEK Baidoo,ASM Applied and environmental Microbiology,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.06017-11,"Efficient biosynthesis of l-tyrosine from glucose is necessary to make biological production economically viable. To this end, we designed and constructed a modular biosynthetic pathway for l-tyrosine production in E. coli MG1655 by encoding the enzymes for converting erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to l-tyrosine on two plasmids. Rational engineering to improve l-tyrosine production and to identify pathway bottlenecks was directed by targeted proteomics and metabolite profiling. The bottlenecks in the pathway were relieved by modifications in plasmid copy numbers, promoter strength, gene codon usage, and the placement of genes in operons. One major bottleneck was due to the bifunctional activities of quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (YdiB), which caused accumulation of the intermediates dehydroquinate (DHQ) and dehydroshikimate (DHS) and the side product quinate; this bottleneck was relieved by replacing YdiB with its paralog AroE, resulting in the production of over 700 mg/liter of shikimate. Another bottleneck in shikimate production, due to low expression of the dehydroquinate synthase (AroB), was alleviated by optimizing the first 15 codons of the gene. Shikimate conversion to l-tyrosine was improved by replacing the shikimate kinase AroK with its isozyme, AroL, which effectively consumed all intermediates formed in the first half of the pathway. Guided by the protein and metabolite measurements, the best producer, consisting of two medium-copy-number, dual-operon plasmids, was optimized to produce >2 g/liter l-tyrosine at 80% of the theoretical yield. This work demonstrates the utility of targeted proteomics and metabolite profiling in pathway construction and optimization, which should be applicable to other metabolic pathways."
Expression of the human molecular chaperone domain Bri2 BRICHOS on a gram per liter scale with an E. coli fed-batch culture,"Schmuck, B., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-021-01638-8,"BACKGROUND: The human Bri2 BRICHOS domain inhibits amyloid formation and toxicity and could be used as a therapeutic agent against amyloid diseases. For translation into clinical use, large quantities of correctly folded recombinant human (rh) Bri2 BRICHOS are required. To increase the expression and solubility levels of rh Bri2 BRICHOS it was fused to NT*, a solubility tag derived from the N-terminal domain of a spider silk protein, which significantly increases expression levels and solubility of target proteins. To increase the expression levels even further and reach the g/L range, which is a prerequisite for an economical production on an industrial scale, we developed a fed-batch expression protocol for Escherichia coli. RESULTS: A fed-batch production method for NT*-Bri2 BRICHOS was set up and systematically optimized. This gradual improvement resulted in expression levels of up to 18.8 g/L. Following expression, NT*-Bri2 BRICHOS was purified by chromatographic methods to a final yield of up to 6.5 g/L. After removal of the NT*-tag and separation into different oligomeric species, activity assays verified that different assembly states of the fed-batch produced rh Bri2 BRICHOS have the same ability to inhibit fibrillar and non-fibrillar protein aggregation as the reference protein isolated from shake flask cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol developed in this work allows the production of large quantities of rh Bri2 BRICHOS using the solubility enhancing NT*-tag as a fusion partner, which is required to effectively conduct pre-clinical research."
Metabolic Engineering for Overproduction of Colanic Acid in Escherichia coli Mutant with Short Lipopolysaccharide,"Zhan, Y., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03053,"Colanic acid is a major exopolysaccharide existing in most Enterobacteriaceae when exposed to an extreme environment. Colanic acid possesses excellent physical properties and biological activities, which makes it a candidate in the food and healthcare market. Previous strategies for colanic acid overproduction in E. coli mainly focus on removing the negative regulator on colanic acid biosynthesis or overexpressing the rcsA gene to up-regulate the cps operon. In this study, modifications in metabolic pathways were implemented in E. coli mutant strains with shortened lipopolysaccharides to improve colanic acid production. First, ackA was deleted to remove the byproduct acetate and the effect of accumulated acetyl-phosphate on colanic acid production was investigated. Second, 11 genes responsible for O-antigen synthesis were deleted to reduce its competition for glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose with colanic acid production. Third, uppS was overexpressed to supply lipid carriers for synthesizing a colanic acid repeat unit. Colanic acid production in the final engineered strain WZM008/pTrcS reached 11.68 g/L in a 2.0 L bioreactor, 3.54 times the colanic acid production by the WQM001 strain.

This MK pathway was a re-engineered version of beta-oxidation designed to overproduce beta-ketoacyl-CoAs and involved overexpression of the fadM thioesterase gene. Here, we document metabolic engineering modifications that have led to a MK titer of 3.4 g/L after ~45 h of fed-batch glucose fermentation and attainment of 40% of the maximum theoretical yield (the best values reported to date for MK). Modifications included balancing overexpression of fadR and fadD to increase fatty acid flux into the pathway, consolidation of the pathway from two plasmids into one, codon optimization, and knocking out key acetate production pathways. In vitro studies confirmed that a decarboxylase is not required to convert beta-keto acids into MK and that FadM is promiscuous and can hydrolyze several CoA-thioester pathway intermediates."
Quantitative analysis of the fermentative metabolism of glycerol in Escherichia coli,"Cintolesi, A., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.23309,"Availability, low price, and high degree of reduction have made glycerol a highly attractive and exploited carbon source for the production of fuels and reduced chemicals. Here we report the quantitative analysis of the fermentative metabolism of glycerol in Escherichia coli through the use of kinetic modeling and metabolic control analysis (MCA) to gain a better understanding of glycerol fermentation and identify key targets for genetic manipulation that could enhance product synthesis. The kinetics of glycerol fermentation in a batch culture was simulated using a dynamic model consisting of mass balances for glycerol, ethanol, biomass, and 11 intracellular metabolites, along with the corresponding kinetic expressions for the metabolism of each species. The model was then used to calculate metabolic control coefficients and elucidate the control structure of the pathways involved in glycerol utilization and ethanol synthesis. The calculated flux control coefficients indicate that the glycolytic flux during glycerol fermentation is almost exclusively controlled by the enzymes glycerol dehydrogenase (encoded by gldA) and dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) (encoded by dhaKLM). In agreement with the MCA findings, overexpression of gldA and dhaKLM led to significant increase in glycerol utilization and ethanol synthesis fluxes. Moreover, overexpression of other enzymes involved in the pathways that mediate glycerol utilization and its conversion to ethanol had no significant impact on glycerol utilization and ethanol synthesis, further validating the MCA predictions. These findings were then applied as a means of increasing the production of ethanol: overexpression of glycerol dehyrdogenase and DHAK enabled the production of 20 g/L ethanol from crude glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, indicating the potential for industrial scale conversion of waste glycerol to ethanol under anaerobic conditions."
Improving astaxanthin production in Escherichia coli by co-utilizing CrtZ enzymes with different substrate preference,"Zhang, M., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-022-01798-1,"BACKGROUND: The bifunctional enzyme beta-carotene hydroxylase (CrtZ) catalyzes the hydroxylation of carotenoid beta-ionone rings at the 3, 3' position regardless of the presence of keto group at 4, 4' position, which is an important step in the synthesis of astaxanthin. The level and substrate preference of CrtZ may have great effect on the amount of astaxanthin and the accumulation of intermediates. RESULTS: In this study, the substrate preference of PCcrtZ from Paracoccus sp. PC1 and PAcrtZ from Pantoea Agglomerans were certified and were combined utilization for increase astaxanthin production. Firstly, PCcrtZ from Paracoccus sp. PC1 and PAcrtZ from P. Agglomerans were expressed in platform strains CAR032 (beta-carotene producing strain) and Can004 (canthaxanthin producing strain) separately to identify their substrate preference for carotenoids with keto groups at 4,4' position or not. The results showed that PCcrtZ led to a lower zeaxanthin yield in CAR032 compared to that of PAcrtZ. On the contrary, higher astaxanthin production was obtained in Can004 by PCcrtZ than that of PAcrtZ. This demonstrated that PCCrtZ has higher canthaxanthin to astaxanthin conversion ability than PACrtZ, while PACrtZ prefer using beta-carotene as substrate. Finally, Ast010, which has two copies of PAcrtZ and one copy of PCcrtZ produced 1.82 g/L of astaxanthin after 70 h of fed-batch fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Combined utilization of crtZ genes, which have beta-carotene and canthaxanthin substrate preference respectively, can greatly enhance the production of astaxanthin and increase the ratio of astaxanthin among total carotenoids."
"Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of 1,2âpropanediol from glycerol","JM Clomburg, R Gonzalez",Biotechnology and bioengineering,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.22993,"Due to its availability, low-price, and high degree of reduction, glycerol has become an attractive carbon source for the production of fuels and reduced chemicals. Using the platform we have established from the identification of key pathways mediating fermentative metabolism of glycerol, this work reports the engineering of Escherichia coli for the conversion of glycerol into 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO). A functional 1,2-PDO pathway was engineered through a combination of overexpression of genes involved in its synthesis from the key intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and the manipulation of the fermentative glycerol utilization pathway. The former included the overexpression of methylglyoxal synthase (mgsA), glycerol dehydrogenase (gldA), and aldehyde oxidoreductase (yqhD). Manipulation of the glycerol utilization pathway through the replacement of the native E. coli PEP-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) with an ATP-dependent DHAK from C. freundii increased the availability of DHAP allowing for higher 1,2-PDO production. Analysis of the major fermentative pathways indentified ethanol as a required co-product while increases in 1,2-PDO titer and yield were achieved through the disruption of the pathways for acetate and lactate production. Combination of these key metabolic manipulations resulted in an engineered E. coli strain capable of producing 5.6âg/L 1,2-PDO, at a yield of 21.3% (w/w). This strain also performed well when crude glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, was used as the substrate.

Engineering global transcription factor cyclic AMP receptor protein of Escherichia coli for improved 1-butanol tolerance,"Zhang, H., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4012-5,"One major challenge in biofuel production, including biobutanol production, is the low tolerance of the microbial host towards increasing biofuel concentration during fermentation. Here, we have demonstrated that Escherichia coli 1-butanol tolerance can be greatly enhanced through random mutagenesis of global transcription factor cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). Four mutants (MT1-MT4) with elevated 1-butanol tolerance were isolated from error-prone PCR libraries through an enrichment screening. A DNA shuffling library was then constructed using MT1-MT4 as templates and one mutant (MT5) that exhibited the best tolerance ability among all variants was selected. In the presence of 0.8 % (v/v, 6.5 g/l) 1-butanol, the growth rate of MT5 was found to be 0.28 h(-1) while that of wild type was 0.20 h(-1). When 1-butanol concentration increased to 1.2 % (9.7 g/l), the growth rate of MT5 (0.18 h(-1)) became twice that of the wild type (0.09 h(-1)). Microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon test showed that cell surface of MT5 was less hydrophobic and its cell length became significantly longer in the presence of 1-butanol, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that several CRP regulated, 1-butanol stress response related genes (rpoH, ompF, sodA, manX, male, and marA) demonstrated differential expression in MT5 in the presence or absence of 1-butanol. In conclusion, direct manipulation of the transcript profile through engineering global transcription factor CRP can provide a useful tool in strain engineering."
High cell density cultivation of Escherichia coli K4 in a microfiltration bioreactor: a step towards improvement of chondroitin precursor production,"Restaino, O. F., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-10-10,"BACKGROUND: The bacteria Escherichia coli K4 produces a capsular polysaccharide (K4 CPS) whose backbone is similar to the non sulphated chondroitin chain. The chondroitin sulphate is one of the major components of the extra-cellular matrix of the vertebrate connective tissues and a high value molecule, widely employed as active principle in the treatment of osteoarthritis. It is usually obtained by extraction from animal tissues, but the risk of virus contaminations, as well as the scarceness of raw material, makes this productive process unsafe and unable to satisfy the growing market demand. In previous studies a new biotechnological process to produce chondroitin from Escherichia coli K4 capsular polysaccharide was investigated and a 1.4 g.L(-1) K4 CPS concentration was reached using fed-batch fermentation techniques. In this work, on the trail of these results, we exploited new fermentation strategies to further improve the capsular polysaccharide production. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect of acetate on the bacterial cells growth and K4 CPS production was studied in shake flask conditions, while a new approach, that combined the optimization of the feeding profiles, the improvement of aeration conditions and the use of a microfiltration bioreactor, was investigated in three different types of fermentation processes. High polysaccharide concentrations (4.73 +/- 0.2 g.L(-1)), with corresponding average yields (0.13 +/- 0.006 gK4 CPS.gcdw(-1)), were obtained the increase of K4 CPS titre, compared to batch and fed-batch results, was of 16-fold and 3.3-fold respectively, while average yield was almost 3.5 and 1.4 fold higher. CONCLUSION: The increase of capsular polysaccharide titre confirmed the validity of the proposed fermentation strategy and opened the way to the use of the microfiltration bioreactor for the biotechnological production of chondroitin."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for quinolinic acid production by assembling L-aspartate oxidase and quinolinate synthase as an enzyme complex,"Zhu, F., et al.",Metab Eng,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2021.06.007,"Quinolinic acid (QA) is a key intermediate of nicotinic acid (Niacin) which is an essential human nutrient and widely used in food and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, a quinolinic acid producer was constructed by employing comprehensive engineering strategies. Firstly, the quinolinic acid production was improved by deactivation of NadC (to block the consumption pathway), NadR (to eliminate the repression of L-aspartate oxidase and quinolinate synthase), and PtsG (to slow the glucose utilization rate and achieve a more balanced metabolism, and also to increase the availability of the precursor phosphoenolpyruvate). Further modifications to enhance quinolinic acid production were investigated by increasing the oxaloacetate pool through overproduction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and deactivation of acetate-producing pathway enzymes. Moreover, quinolinic acid production was accelerated by assembling NadB and NadA as an enzyme complex with the help of peptide-peptide interaction peptides RIAD and RIDD, which resulted in up to 3.7 g/L quinolinic acid being produced from 40 g/L glucose in shake-flask cultures. A quinolinic acid producer was constructed in this study, and these results lay a foundation for further engineering of microbial cell factories to efficiently produce quinolinic acid and subsequently convert this product to nicotinic acid for industrial applications."
fadD deletion and fadL overexpression in Escherichia coli increase hydroxy long-chain fatty acid productivity,"Bae, J. H., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-5974-2,"A major problem of long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) hydroxylation using Escherichia coli is that FadD (long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase), which is necessary for exogenous LCFA transport, also initiates cellular consumption of LCFA. In this study, an effective method to prevent the cellular consumption of LCFA without impairing its transport is proposed. The main idea is that a heterologous enzyme which consumes LCFA can replace FadD in LCFA transport. For the model heterologous enzyme, CYP153A from Marinobacter aquaeolei, which converts palmitic acid into omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, was expressed in E. coli. When fadD was deleted from an E. coli strain, CYP153A indeed maintained the ability to transport LCFA. A disadvantage of fadD deletion mutant is the fact that FadD deficiency downregulates the transcription of fadL (outer membrane LCFA transporter) via FadR (fatty acid metabolism regulator protein), was solved by fadL overexpression from a plasmid. In addition, the overexpression of fadL was able to offset catabolite repression on fadL, allowing glucose to be used as the primary carbon source. In conclusion, the strain with fadD deletion and fadL overexpression showed 5.5-fold increase in productivity compared to the wild-type strain, converting 2.6 g/L (10.0 mM) of palmitic acid into 2.4 g/L (8.8 mM) of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid in a shake flask. This simple genetic manipulation can be applied to any LCFA hydroxylation using E. coli."
Engineering of a UDP-Glycosyltransferase for the Efficient Whole-Cell Biosynthesis of Siamenoside I in Escherichia coli,"Xu, Y., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07699,"The combination of the insufficient availability and the complex structure of siamenoside I (SI), the sweetest glucoside isolated from Siraitia grosvenorii to date, limited its use as a natural sweetener. To solve this problem, an improved biocatalyst, UGT-M2, was semi-rationally created by engineering the uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase UGT94-289-2 from S. grosvenorii for the monoglucosylation of mogroside IIIE (MG IIIE) to SI. Subsequently, an engineered Escherichia coli cell was constructed, which combined UGT-M2 with a UDP-glucose regeneration system to circumvent the need for expensive UDP-glucose to produce SI. After optimization, high-purity SI (>96.4%) was efficiently prepared from MG IIIE at a 1 L scale with a productivity of 29.78 g/(L day) and a molar yield of 76.5% and without using exogenous UDP-glucose. This study not only developed a whole-cell approach for the preparation of SI but also provided an alternative glycosyltransferase variant for SI biosynthesis with synthetic biology in the future."
Biosynthesis of Î²-carotene in engineered E. coli using the MEP and MVA pathways,"J Yang, L Guo",Microbial cell factories,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-014-0160-x,"To increase Î²-carotene production by improving the isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and geranyl diphospate (GPP) concentration in the cell, the optimized MEP (methylerythritol 4-phosphate) pathway containing 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase (FNI) from Bacillus subtilis, geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS2) from Abies grandis have been co-expressed in an engineered E. coli strain. To further enhance the production of Î²-carotene, the hybrid MVA (mevalonate) pathway has been introduced into an engineered E. coli strain, co-expressed with the optimized MEP pathway and GPPS2.

Subsequently, the fermentation process was optimized to enhance Î²-carotene production with a maximum titer of 256.8±10.4 mg/L. Finally, the fed-batch fermentation of Î²-carotene was evaluated using the optimized culture conditions. After induction for 56 h, the final engineered strain YJM49 accumulated 3.2 g/L Î²-carotene with a volumetric productivity of 0.37 mg/(L · h · OD600) in aerobic fed-batch fermentation, and the conversion efficiency of glycerol to Î²-carotene (gram to gram) reached 2.76%."
Precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle in Escherichia coli for efficient tyrosine production from acetate,"Jo, M., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-019-1106-0,"BACKGROUND: Acetate is one of promising feedstocks owing to its cheap price and great abundance. Considering that tyrosine production is gradually shifting to microbial production method, its production from acetate can be attempted to further improve the economic feasibility of its production. RESULTS: Here, we engineered a previously reported strain, SCK1, for efficient production of tyrosine from acetate. Initially, the acetate uptake and gluconeogenic pathway were amplified to maximize the flux toward tyrosine. As flux distribution between glyoxylate and TCA cycles is critical for efficient precursor supplementation, the activity of the glyoxylate cycle was precisely controlled by expression of isocitrate lyase gene under different-strength promoters. Consequently, the engineered strain with optimal flux distribution produced 0.70 g/L tyrosine with 20% of the theoretical maximum yield which are 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold increased values of the parental strain. CONCLUSIONS: Tyrosine production from acetate requires precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle and we obtained substantial improvements in production titer and yield by synthetic promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). This is the first demonstration of tyrosine production from acetate. Our strategies would be widely applicable to the production of various chemicals from acetate in future."
Roasted coffee wastes as a substrate for Escherichia coli to grow and produce hydrogen,"Petrosyan, H., et al.",FEMS Microbiol Lett,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnaa088,"After brewing roasted coffee, spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are generated being one of the daily wastes emerging in dominant countries with high rate and big quantity. Escherichia coli BW25113 wild-type strain, mutants with defects in hydrogen (H2)-producing/oxidizing four hydrogenases (Hyd) (DeltahyaB DeltahybC, DeltahycE, DeltahyfG) and septuple mutant (DeltahyaB DeltahybC DeltahycA DeltafdoG DeltaldhA DeltafrdC DeltaaceE) were investigated by measuring change of external pH, bacterial growth and H2 production during the utilization of SCG hydrolysate. In wild type, H2 was produced with rate of 1.28 mL H2 (g sugar)-1 h-1 yielding 30.7 mL H2 (g sugar)-1 or 2.75 L (kg SCG)-1 during 24 h. In septuple mutant, H2 production yield was 72 mL H2 (g sugar)-1 with rate of 3 mL H2 (g sugar)-1 h-1. H2 generation was absent in hycE single mutant showing the main role of Hyd-3 in H2 production. During utilization of SCG wild type, specific growth rate was 0.72 +/- 0.01 h-1 with biomass yield of 0.3 g L-1. Genetic modifications and control of external parameters during growth could lead to prolonged and enhanced microbiological H2 production by organic wastes, which will aid more efficiently global sustainable energy needs resulting in diversification of mobile and fixed energy sources."
Synergy between methylerythritol phosphate pathway and mevalonate pathway for isoprene production in Escherichia coli,X Gao,Metabolic engineering,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2016.05.003,"Isoprene, a key building block of synthetic rubber, is currently produced entirely from petrochemical sources. In this work, we engineered both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway for isoprene production in E. coli. The synergy between the MEP pathway and the MVA pathway was demonstrated by the production experiment, in which overexpression of both pathways improved the isoprene yield about 20-fold and 3-fold, respectively, compared to overexpression of the MEP pathway or the MVA pathway alone. The 13C metabolic flux analysis revealed that simultaneous utilization of the two pathways resulted in a 4.8-fold increase in the MEP pathway flux and a 1.5-fold increase in the MVA pathway flux. The synergy of the dual pathway was further verified by quantifying intracellular flux responses of the MEP pathway and the MVA pathway to fosmidomycin treatment and mevalonate supplementation. Our results strongly suggest that coupling of the complementary reducing equivalent demand and ATP requirement plays an important role in the synergy of the dual pathway. Fed-batch cultivation of the engineered strain overexpressing the dual pathway resulted in production of 24.0 g/L isoprene with a yield of 0.267 g/g of glucose. The synergy of the MEP pathway and the MVA pathway also successfully increased the lycopene productivity in E. coli, which demonstrates that it can be used to improve the production of a broad range of terpenoids in microorganisms."
"Engineering Escherichia coli for a high yield of 1,3-propanediol near the theoretical maximum through chromosomal integration and gene deletion","Wong, N. and K.

The developed E. coli NSK015 (âldhA::gdrAB-dhaB123 âackA::FRT âpflB::yqhD âfrdABCD::cat-sacB) produced 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) at the level of 36.8 g/L with a yield of 0.99 mol/mol of glycerol consumed when glucose was used as a co-substrate with glycerol. Co-substrate of glycerol and cassava starch was also utilized for 1,3-PDO production with the concentration and yield of 31.9 g/L and 0.84 mol/mol of glycerol respectively. This represents a work for efficient 1,3-PDO production in which the overexpression of heterologous genes on the E. coli host genome devoid of plasmid expression systems. Plasmids, antibiotics, IPTG, and rich nutrients were omitted during 1,3-PDO production. This may allow a further application of E. coli NSK015 for the efficient 1,3-PDO production in an economically industrial scale. KEY POINTS: * gdrAB-dhaB123 and yqhD were overexpressed in E. coli devoid of a plasmid system * E. coli NSK015 produced a high yield of 1,3-PDO at 99% theoretical maximum * Cassava starch was alternatively used as substrate for economical 1,3-PDO production."

L-49973 (StGetF) were screened to achieve the conversion of L-lysine to cis-3-HyPip. Considering the high-cost of cofactors, NAD(P)H oxidase from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (LsNox) was further overexpressed in chassis strain Escherichia coli W3110 DeltasucCD (alpha-ketoglutarate-producing strain) to construct the NAD(+) regeneration system, thus realizing the bioconversion of cis-3-HyPip from low-cost substrate L-lysine without NAD(+) and alpha-ketoglutarate addition. To further accelerate the transmission efficiency of cis-3-HyPip biosynthetic pathway, multiple-enzyme expression optimization and transporter dynamic regulation via promoter engineering were conducted. Through fermentation optimization, the final engineered strain HP-13 generated 78.4 g/L cis-3-HyPip with 78.9% conversion in a 5-L fermenter, representing the highest production level achieved so far. These strategies described herein show promising potentials for large-scale production of cis-3-HyPip."

Calcium Carbonate Addition Improves L-Methionine Biosynthesis by Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli W3110-BL,"Zhou, H. Y., et al.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00300,"L-Methionine (L-Met) is a sulfur-containing amino acid, which is one of the eight essential amino acids to human body. In this work, the fermentative production of L-Met with genetically engineered Escherichia coli W3110-BL in a 5-L fermentor was enhanced through supplement of Ca(2+) into the fermentation medium. With the addition of 30 g/L calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)), the titer of L-Met and yield against glucose reached 1.48 g/L and 0.09 mol/mol glucose, 57.45% higher than those of the control, respectively. The flux balance analysis (FBA) revealed that addition of CaCO(3) strengthened the tricarboxylic acid cycle and increased the intracellular ATP concentration by 39.28%. The re-distribution of carbon, ATP, and cofactors flux may collaborate to improve L-Met biosynthesis with E. coli W3110-BL.

Formate and potassium ions affect Escherichia coli proton ATPase activity at low pH during mixed carbon fermentation,"Gevorgyan, H., et al.",IUBMB Life,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2219,"Escherichia coli is able to ferment not only single but also mixtures of carbon sources. The formate metabolism and effect of formate on various enzymes have been extensively studied during sole glucose but not mixed carbon sources utilization. It was revealed that in membrane vesicles (MV) of wild type cells grown at pH 7.5 during fermentation of the mixture of glucose (2 g/L), glycerol (10 g/L), and formate (0.68 g/L), in the assays, the addition of formate (10 mM) increased the N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-inhibited ATPase activity on ~30% but no effect of potassium ions (100 mM) had been detected. In selC (coding formate dehydrogenases) and fdhF (coding formate dehydrogenase H) single mutants, formate increased DCCD-inhibited ATPase activity on ~40 and ~70%, respectively. At pH 5.5, in wild type cells MV, formate decreased the DCCD-inhibited ATPase activity ~60% but unexpectedly in the presence of potassium ions, it was stimulated ~5.8 fold. The accessible SH or thiol groups number in fdhF mutant was less by 28% compared with wild type. In formate assays, the available SH groups number was less ~10% in wild type but not in fdhF mutant. Taken together, the data suggest that proton ATPase activity depends on externally added formate in the presence of potassium ions at low pH. This effect might be regulated by the changes in the number of redox-active thiol groups via formate dehydrogenase H, which might be directly related to proton ATPase F(O) subunit."
Escherichia coli as an antibody expression host for the production of diagnostic proteins: significance and expression,"Huleani, S., et al.",Crit Rev Biotechnol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2021.1967871,"This review article concerns the production of recombinant antibody fragments for applications mainly in the diagnostic sector. The so-called point of care diagnostics is very important for timely diagnosis and treatment, thus being able to save lives and resources. There is intense pressure for more accurate and less expensive rapid diagnostic tests, with a value preferably <$1. Thus, the large-scale cost-effective production of recombinant antibodies is vital. The importance of Escherichia coli toward the production of inexpensive rapid tests will be explained in this review paper. Details about the different strains of E. coli, the strategies used for the insertion and the expression of recombinant proteins, and the challenges that still exist are provided. Afterward, the importance of the expression scale and culture parameters in the final yield of the antibodies are examined. From this analysis, it appears that for good yields of recombinant antibodies, aside from appropriate gene transfer and expression, the culturing parameters are of paramount importance. Larger scale production is more favorable, mainly due to the higher cell densities that can be achieved. Yields of functional Fab fragments in the range of 10-20 mg/L are considered good in shake flasks, whereas in bioreactors can be up to 1-2 g/L. An amount of 10-500 mg of such antibody per million rapid tests is required. Despite the substantial importance of the production of the antibodies and their fragments, their downstream processing should be appropriately considered from the beginning for achieving the target value of the final rapid diagnostic tests."

An initial liquefaction step (L) with cellulase was included to improve mixing and saccharification (L+SScF), analogous to a corn ethanol process. Fermentation was enabled by the development of a hydrolysate-resistant mutant of Escherichia coli LY180, designated MM160. Strain MM160 was more resistant than the parent to inhibitors (furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and acetate) formed during pretreatment. Bagasse slurries containing 10% and 14% dry weight (fiber plus solubles) were tested using pretreatment temperatures of 160-190 degrees C (1% phosphoric acid, 10 min). Enzymatic saccharification and inhibitor production both increased with pretreatment temperature.

Pathway engineering of Escherichia coli for one-step fermentative production of L-theanine from sugars and ethylamine,"Fan, X., et al.",Metab Eng Commun,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mec.2020.e00151,"L-theanine is the most abundant free amino acid in tea that offers various favorable physiological and pharmacological effects. Bacterial enzyme of gamma-glutamylmethylamide synthetase (GMAS) can catalyze the synthesis of theanine from glutamate, ethylamine and ATP, but the manufacturing cost is uncompetitive due to the expensive substrates and complex processes. In this study, we described pathway engineering of wild-type Escherichia coli for one-step fermentative production of theanine from sugars and ethylamine. First, the synthetic pathway of theanine was conducted by heterologous introduction of a novel GMAS from Paracoccus aminovorans. A xylose-induced T7 RNA polymerase-P (T7) promoter system was used to enhance and control gmas gene expression. Next, the precursor glutamate pool was increased by overexpression of native citrate synthase and introduction of glutamate dehydrogenase from Corynebacterium glutamicum. Then, in order to push more carbon flux towards theanine synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle was interrupted and pyruvate carboxylase from C. glutamicum was introduced as a bypath supplying oxaloacetate from pyruvate. Finally, an energy-conserving phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from Mannheimia succiniciproducens was introduced to increase ATP yield for theanine synthesis. After optimizing the addition time and concentration of ethylamine hydrochloride in the fed-batch fermentation, the recombinant strain TH11 produced 70.6 âg/L theanine in a 5-L bioreactor with a yield and productivity of 0.42 âg/g glucose and 2.72 âg/L/h, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the pathway engineering of E. coli for fermentative production of theanine. The high production capacity of recombinant strain, combined with the easy processes, will hold attractive industrial application potential for the future."
Efficient Biosynthesis of Xylitol from Xylose by Coexpression of Xylose Reductase and Glucose Dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli,"Jin, L. Q., et al.",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2878-0,"Xylitol is an important functional sugar alcohol which is widely used in industries. To efficiently produce xylitol from xylose by xylose reductase in a single step, the coupled system and the coexpression system using xylose reductase (XR) from Rhizopus oryzae and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from Exiguobacterium sibiricum were constructed, the latter of which was used for cofactor regeneration. One hundred fifty grams/liter of xylose could be fully converted to xylitol by employing the two-enzyme coupled system with cell-free extract, and xylitol productivity of 21.2 g/L/h was reached by biotransformation in vitro. The whole-cell biocatalyst coexpressing xylose reductase and glucose dehydrogenase was successfully used to synthesize xylitol via enzymatic reduction of xylose. After optimization of the induction condition, the enzyme activity reached 1533 U/L. Two hundred grams/liter of xylose could be completely converted to xylitol, and the highest xylitol productivity of 6.37 g/L/h was obtained under the optimal transformation conditions. Thus, recombinant Escherichia coli coexpressing xylose reductase and glucose dehydrogenase is a promising candidate for xylitol production from xylose."
Experimental and computational optimization of an Escherichia coli co-culture for the efficient production of flavonoids,"JA Jones, SM Collins",Metabolic Engineering,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2016.01.006,"Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have enabled the use of microbial production platforms for the renewable production of many high-value natural products. Titers and yields, however, are often too low to result in commercially viable processes. Microbial co-cultures have the ability to distribute metabolic burden and allow for modular specific optimization in a way that is not possible through traditional monoculture fermentation methods. Here, we present an Escherichia coli co-culture for the efficient production of flavonoids in vivo, resulting in a 970-fold improvement in titer of flavan-3-ols over previously published monoculture production. To accomplish this improvement in titer, factors such as strain compatibility, carbon source, temperature, induction point, and inoculation ratio were initially optimized. The development of an empirical scaled-Gaussian model based on the initial optimization data was then implemented to predict the optimum point for the system. Experimental verification of the model predictions resulted in a 65% improvement in titer, to 40.7±0.1 mg/L flavan-3-ols, over the previous optimum. Overall, this study demonstrates the first application of the co-culture production of flavonoids, the most in-depth co-culture optimization to date, and the first application of empirical systems modeling for improvement of titers from a co-culture system."
Expression of arsenic regulatory protein in Escherichia coli for selective accumulation of methylated arsenic species,"Yang, T., et al.",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/am400578y,"ArsR is a metalloregulatory protein with high selectivity and affinity toward arsenic. We hereby report the expression of ArsR in Escherichia coli by cell engineering, which significantly enhances the adsorption/accumulation capacity of methylated arsenic species. The ArsR-expressed E. coli cells (denoted as E. coli-ArsR) give rise to 5.6-fold and 3.4-fold improvements on the adsorption/accumulation capacity for monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), with respect to native E. coli cells. The uptake of MMA and DMA by the E. coli-ArsR is a fast process fitting Langmuir adsorption model. It is interesting to note that the accumulation of methylated arsenic is virtually not affected by the presence of competing heavy-metal species, at least 10 times of Cd(II) and Pb(II) are tolerated for the adsorption of 1 mg L(-1) methylated arsenic. In addition, an ionic strength of up to 2 g L(-1) Na+ poses no obvious effect on the sorption of 1 mg L(-1) MMA and DMA. Furthermore, the accumulation of MMA and DMA is less sensitive to the variation of pH value, with respect to the blank control cells. Consequently, 82.4% of MMA and 96.3% of DMA at a concentration of 50 mug L(-1) could be readily removed from aqueous medium by 12 g L(-1) of E. coli-ArsR . This illustrates a great potential for the E. coli-ArsR for selective remediation of methylated arsenic species in waters, even in the presence of a high concentration of salts."
"High-Level Production of Amorpha-4,11-Diene, a Precursor of the Antimalarial Agent Artemisinin, in Escherichia coli","H Tsuruta, CJ Paddon, D Eng, JR Lenihan, T Horningâ¦",PLoS one,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004489,"By combining improvements in the heterologous mevalonate pathway with a superior fermentation process, commercially relevant titers were achieved in fed-batch fermentations. Yeast genes for HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase (the second and third enzymes in the pathway) were replaced with equivalent genes from Staphylococcus aureus, more than doubling production. Amorpha-4,11-diene titers were further increased by optimizing nitrogen delivery in the fermentation process. Successful cultivation of the improved strain under carbon and nitrogen restriction consistently yielded 90 g/L dry cell weight and an average titer of 27.4 g/L amorpha-4,11-diene."
Esterification of geraniol as a strategy for increasing product titre and specificity in engineered Escherichia coli,"Chacon, M. G., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-019-1130-0,"BACKGROUND: Geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol, is found as a primary constituent in the essential oils of plants such as geranium, lemongrass and rose. The floral-like scent of geraniol has made it a popular constituent of flavour and fragrance products. Over recent decades biotechnology has made significant progress towards the development of industrial platforms for the production of commercially valuable monoterpenoids, such as geraniol, through expression of recombinant terpene biosynthetic pathways in microbial hosts. Titres, however, have been hindered due to the inherent toxicity of these compounds-which are often utilised for anti-microbial and anti-fungal functions in their host plant. RESULTS: In this study we modified an Escherichia coli strain, engineered to express a heterologous mevalonate pathway, by replacement of the terpene synthase with a geraniol synthase from Ocimum basilicum for the production of geraniol, and co-expressed an alcohol acyltransferase (AAT) from Rosa hybrida for the specific acetylation of geraniol. The low water solubility of geranyl acetate facilitated its partition into the organic phase of a two-phase system, relieving the cellular toxicity attributed to the build-up of geraniol in the aqueous phase. In a partially optimised system this strain produced 4.8 g/L geranyl acetate (based on the aqueous volume) which, on a molar equivalent basis, represents the highest monoterpene titre achieved from microbial culture to date. It was also found that esterification of geraniol prevented bioconversion into other monoterpenoids, leading to a significant improvement in product specificity, with geranyl acetate being the sole product observed. CONCLUSION: In this study we have shown that it is possible to both overcome the toxicity limit impeding the production of the monoterpene alcohol geraniol and mitigate product loss in culture through endogenous metabolism by using an in vivo esterification strategy. This strategy has resulted in the highest geraniol (equivalent) titres achieved from a microbial host, and presents esterification as a viable approach to increasing the titres obtained in microbial monoterpenoid production."
Biosynthesis of catechol melanin from glycerol employing metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Mejia-Caballero, A., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-016-0561-0,"BACKGROUND: Melanins comprise a chemically-diverse group of polymeric pigments whose function is related to protection against physical and chemical stress factors. These polymers have current and potential applications in the chemical, medical, electronics and materials industries. The biotechnological production of melanins offers the possibility of obtaining these pigments in pure form and relatively low cost. In this study, Escherichia coli strains were engineered to evaluate the production of melanin from supplemented catechol or from glycerol-derived catechol produced by an Escherichia coli strain generated by metabolic engineering. RESULTS: It was determined that an improved mutant version of the tyrosinase from Rhizobium etli (MutmelA), could employ catechol as a substrate to generate melanin. Strain E. coli W3110 expressing MutmelA was grown in bioreactor batch cultures with catechol supplemented in the medium. Under these conditions, 0.29 g/L of catechol melanin were produced. A strain with the capacity to synthesize catechol melanin from a simple carbon source was generated by integrating the gene MutmelA into the chromosome of E. coli W3110 trpD9923, that has been modified to produce catechol by the expression of genes encoding a feedback inhibition resistant version of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase, transketolase and anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. In batch cultures with this strain employing complex medium with 40 g/L glycerol as a carbon source, 1.21 g/L of catechol melanin were produced. The melanin was analysed by employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, revealing the expected characteristics for a catechol-derived polymer. CONCLUSIONS: This constitutes the first report of an engineered E. coli strain and a fermentation process for producing a catechol melanin from a simple carbon source (glycerol) at gram level, opening the possibility of generating a large quantity of this polymer for its detailed characterization and the development of novel applications."
"Evolution, genomic analysis, and reconstruction of isobutanol tolerance in Escherichia coli","S Atsumi, TY Wu, WC Huang",Molecular systems Biology,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/msb.2010.98,"Escherichia coli has been engineered to produce isobutanol, with titers reaching greater than the toxicity level. However, the specific effects of isobutanol on the cell have never been fully understood. Here, we aim to identify genotypeâphenotype relationships in isobutanol response. An isobutanolâtolerant mutant was isolated with serial transfers. Using wholeâgenome sequencing followed by gene repair and knockout, we identified five mutations (acrA, gatY, tnaA, yhbJ, and marCRAB) that were primarily responsible for the increased isobutanol tolerance. We successfully reconstructed the tolerance phenotype by combining deletions of these five loci, and identified glucosamineâ6âphosphate as an important metabolite for isobutanol tolerance, which presumably enhanced membrane synthesis. The isobutanolâtolerant mutants also show increased tolerance to nâbutanol and 2âmethylâ1âbutanol, but showed no improvement in ethanol tolerance and higher sensitivity to hexane and chloramphenicol than the parental strain. These results suggest that C4, C5 alcohol stress impacts the cell differently compared with the general solvent or antibiotic stresses. Interestingly, improved isobutanol tolerance did not increase the final titer of isobutanol production."
Balancing the carbon flux distributions between the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt to produce glycolate at high yield and titer in Escherichia coli,"Deng, Y., et al.",Metab Eng,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.02.008,"The glyoxylate shunt is a branch of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle which directly determines the synthesis of glycolate, and the balance between the glyoxylate shunt and TCA cycle is very important for the growth of Escherichia coli. In order to accumulate glycolate at high yield and titer, strategies for over-expressing glycolate pathway enzymes including isocitrate lyase (AceA), isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase (AceK) and glyoxylate reductase (YcdW) were analyzed. The genes encoding these three enzymes were transcribed under the control of promoter pTrc on pTrc99A, to form pJNU-3, which was harbored by strain Mgly1, resulting in strain Mgly13. Strain Mgly13 produced glycolate with 0.385â¯g/g-glucose yield (45.2% of the theoretical yield). Citrate synthase (GltA) converted excess acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to citrate and was over-expressed by pJNU-4 (pCDFDuet-1 backbone). Thus, the resulting strain Mgly134 produced glycolate with a 0.504â¯g/g-glucose yield (59.3% of the theoretical yield). We then eliminated the pathways involved in the degradation of glycolate, resulting in strain Mgly434, which produced glycolate with 92.9% of the theoretical yield. Following optimization of fermentation, the maximum glycolate titer from strain Mgly434 was 65.5â¯g/L."
Engineering of an N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetic pathway in Escherichia coli,"Kang, J., et al.",Metab Eng,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2012.09.002,"N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) has recently drawn much attention owing to its wide applications in many aspects. Besides extraction from natural materials, production of NeuAc was recently focused on enzymatic synthesis and whole-cell biocatalysis. In this study, we designed an artificial NeuAc biosynthetic pathway through intermediate N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate in Escherichia coli. In this pathway, N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (slr1975) and glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase (GNA1) were heterologously introduced into E. coli from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100, respectively. By derepressing the feedback inhibition of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, increasing the accumulation of N-acetylglucosamine and pyruvate, and blocking the catabolism of NeuAc, we were able to produce 1.62 g l(-)(1) NeuAc in recombinant E. coli directly from glucose. The NeuAc yield reached 7.85g l(-)(1) in fed-batch fermentation. This process offered an efficient fermentative method to produce NeuAc in microorganisms using glucose as carbon source and can be optimized for further improvement."
Caffeic acid production from glucose using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Sakae, K., et al.",Enzyme Microb Technol,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2023.110193,"Caffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) is a precursor for high-valued compounds with anticancer, antiviral activities, and anti-inflammatory making it an important substance in the food additive, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we developed an engineered Escherichia coli strain capable of directly producing high levels of caffeic acid from glucose. Tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Rhodotorula glutinis (RgTAL) and p-coumaric acid 3-hydroxylase from Saccharothrix espanaensis (SeC3H) were expressed. Next, feedback-resistant chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase, was introduced to promote l-tyrosine synthesis. This engineered strain CA3 produced 1.58 g/L of caffeic acid from glucose without tyrosine supplemented to the medium. Furthermore, to reduce p-coumaric acid accumulation, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaHpaBC) was introduced. Finally, an engineered strain CA8 directly produced 6.17 g/L of caffeic acid from glucose using a jar fermenter. The E. coli developed in this study would be helpful as a chassis strain to produce value-added caffeic acid-derivatives."
Enhancement of dissimilatory nitrate/nitrite reduction to ammonium of Escherichia coli sp. SZQ1 by ascorbic acid: Mechanism and performance,"Su, Z., et al.",Sci Total Environ,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158423,"Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) can be used for nitrogen recovery. However, due to the low conversion efficiency of the DNRA process of microorganisms, the process cannot be industrially applied. Ascorbic acid (ASA) can improve DNRA efficiency of Escherichia coli sp. SZQ1 (E. coli). Experimental studies suggest that 10 g L(-1) ASA promoted DNRA process of E. coli at high concentrations of nitrite (10-20 mM). In the 5 g L(-1) ASA system, 9.2 mM nitrite was reduced to 8.21 mM ammonium by E. coli in 120 h. Mechanistic studies reveal that ASA reduced the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the system and scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell of E. coli. Meanwhile, ASA was utilized by E. coli as the sole carbon source and provided electrons to DNRA process through ASA metabolic pathways. This study proposes a new strategy for increasing the efficiency of DNRA."
In vitro reconstitution of mevalonate pathway and targeted engineering of farnesene overproduction in Escherichia coli,"Zhu, F., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.25198,"Approaches using metabolic engineering and synthetic biology to overproduce terpenoids, such as the precursors of taxol and artemisinin, in microbial systems have achieved initial success. However, due to the lack of steady-state kinetic information and incomplete understanding of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, it has been difficult to build a highly efficient, universal system. Here, we reconstituted the mevalonate pathway to produce farnesene (a precursor of new jet fuel) in vitro using purified protein components. The information from this in vitro reconstituted system guided us to rationally optimize farnesene production in E. coli by quantitatively overexpressing each component. Targeted proteomic assays and intermediate assays were used to determine the metabolic status of each mutant. Through targeted engineering, farnesene production could be increased predictably step by step, up to 1.1 g/L ( approximately 2,000 fold) 96 h after induction at the shake-flask scale. The strategy developed to release the potential of the mevalonate pathway for terpenoid overproduction should also work in other multistep synthetic pathways."
Engineering serine hydroxymethyltransferases for efficient synthesis of L-serine in Escherichia coli,"Teng, Z., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2023.130153,"L-serine is a high-value amino acid widely used in the food, medicine, and cosmetic industries. However, the low yield of L-serine has limited its industrial production. In this study, a cellular factory for efficient synthesis of L-serine was obtained by engineering the serine hydroxymethyltransferases (SHMT). Firstly, after screening the SHMT from Alcanivorax dieselolei by genome mining, a mutant AdSHMT(E266M) with high thermal stability was identified through rational design. Subsequently, an iterative saturating mutant library was constructed by using coevolutionary analysis, and a mutant AdSHMT(E160L/E193Q) with enzyme activity 1.35 times higher than AdSHMT was identified. Additionally, the target protein AdSHMT(E160L/E193Q/E266M) was efficiently overexpressed by improving its mRNA stability. Finally, combining the substrate addition strategy and system optimization, the optimized strain BL21/pET28a-AdSHMT(E160L/E193Q/E266M)-5'UTR-REP3(S16) produced 106.06 g/L L-serine, which is the highest production to date.

Bifunctional optogenetic switch for improving shikimic acid production in E. coli,"Komera, I., et al.",Biotechnol Biofuels Bioprod,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-022-02111-3,"BACKGROUND: Biomass formation and product synthesis decoupling have been proven to be promising to increase the titer of desired value add products. Optogenetics provides a potential strategy to develop light-induced circuits that conditionally control metabolic flux redistribution for enhanced microbial production. However, the limited number of light-sensitive proteins available to date hinders the progress of light-controlled tools. RESULTS: To address these issues, two optogenetic systems (TPRS and TPAS) were constructed by reprogramming the widely used repressor TetR and protease TEVp to expand the current optogenetic toolkit. By merging the two systems, a bifunctional optogenetic switch was constructed to enable orthogonally regulated gene transcription and protein accumulation. Application of this bifunctional switch to decouple biomass formation and shikimic acid biosynthesis allowed 35 g/L of shikimic acid production in a minimal medium from glucose, representing the highest titer reported to date by E. coli without the addition of any chemical inducers and expensive aromatic amino acids. This titer was further boosted to 76 g/L when using rich medium fermentation. CONCLUSION: The cost effective and light-controlled switch reported here provides important insights into environmentally friendly tools for metabolic pathway regulation and should be applicable to the production of other value-add chemicals."
High-Level Production of Indole-3-acetic Acid in the Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli,"Wu, H., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c08141,"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a critical plant hormone that regulates cell division, development, and metabolism. IAA synthesis in plants and plant-associated microorganisms cannot fulfill the requirement for large-scale agricultural production. Here, two novel IAA biosynthesis pathways, tryptamine (TAM) and indole-3-acetamide (IAM), were developed for IAA production by whole-cell catalysis and de novo biosynthesis in an engineered Escherichia coli MG1655. When 10 g/L l-tryptophan was used as a substrate, an MIA-6 strain containing a heterologous IAM pathway had the highest IAA titer of 7.10 g/L (1.34 x 10(3) mg/g DCW), which was 98.4 times more than MTAI-5 containing the TAM pathway by whole-cell catalysis. De novo IAA biosynthesis was optimized by improving NAD(P)H availability, resulting in an increased IAA titer of 906 mg/L obtained by the MGDeltaadhE::icd strain, which is 29.7% higher than the control. These strategies exhibit the potential for IAA production in engineered E. coli and possible industrial applications."
Gram-scale fermentative production of ergothioneine driven by overproduction of cysteine in Escherichia coli,"Tanaka, N., et al.",Sci Rep,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-38382-w,"Ergothioneine (ERG), a unique thiol compound, is suggested to function as an antioxidant and cytoprotectant. Despite several recent attempts to produce ERG using various organisms, its yield was still very low and the costs remained high. Since the level of ERG produced depends strictly on the availability of three distinct precursor amino acids (L-cysteine (Cys), L-histidine, and L-methionine (Met)), metabolic engineering for enhancement of the flux toward ERG biosynthesis is required. Herein, we took advantage of a high-Cys production system using Escherichia coli cells, in which Cys biosynthesis and excretion were activated, and applied it to the fermentative production of ERG from glucose. The Cys overproduction in E. coli cells carrying the egtBCDE genes from Mycobacterium smegmatis was effective for ERG production. Furthermore, coexpression of the egtA gene, which encodes gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase that synthesizes the gamma-glutamylcysteine used as a sulfur source of ERG biosynthesis, enhanced ERG production even though E. coli intrinsically has gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Additionally, disruption of the metJ gene that encodes the transcriptional repressor involved in Met metabolism was effective in further increasing the production of ERG. Finally, we succeeded in the high-level production of 1.31 g/L ERG in a fed-batch culture process using a jar fermenter."
Enhanced chromate reduction by resting Escherichia coli cells in the presence of quinone redox mediators,"Liu, G., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.06.050,"The reduction of Cr(VI) by resting Escherichia coli cells was significantly enhanced by the quinone redox mediators, lawsone, menadione, anthraquinone-2-sulfonate and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. In the presence of 0.2 mM lawsone, over 97.5% Cr(VI) (100 mg l(-1)) was reduced in 4h. The mediated reduction occurred at initial Cr(VI) concentrations of 50-250 mg l(-1), and increased with increasing initial biomass concentrations from 0.05 to 1.2 g l(-1). The addition of glucose as electron donor promoted the reduction process. Cu(2+), Ni(2+) and Co(2+) inhibited, whereas Mn(2+) and Pb(2+) stimulated reduction. Four rounds of mediated reduction were completed in 19 h, suggesting its stability and persistence. The efficient mediated microbial reduction of Cr(VI) is promising for rapid anaerobic removal of chromate."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for 1-butanol and 1-propanol production via the keto-acid pathways,"Shen, C. R. and J. C. Liao",Metab Eng,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2008.08.001,"Production of higher alcohols via the keto-acid intermediates found in microorganism's native amino-acid pathways has recently shown promising results. In this work, an Escherichia coli strain that produces 1-butanol and 1-propanol from glucose was constructed. The strain first converts glucose to 2-ketobutyrate, a common keto-acid intermediate for isoleucine biosynthesis. Then, 2-ketobutyrate is converted to 1-propanol through reactions catalyzed by the heterologous decarboxylase and dehydrogenase, or to 1-butanol via the chemistry involved in the synthesis of the unnatural amino acid norvaline. We systematically improved the synthesis of 1-propanol and 1-butanol through deregulation of amino-acid biosynthesis and elimination of competing pathways. The final strain demonstrated a production titer of 2 g/L with nearly 1:1 ratio of butanol and propanol."
Improvement of shikimic acid production in Escherichia coli with growth phase-dependent regulation in the biosynthetic pathway from glycerol,"Lee, M. Y., et al.",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11274-016-2192-3,"Shikimic acid is an important metabolic intermediate with various applications. This paper presents a novel control strategy for the construction of shikimic acid producing strains, without completely blocking the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Growth phase-dependent expression and gene deletion was performed to regulate the aroK gene expression in the shikimic acid producing Escherichia coli strain, SK4/rpsM. In this strain, the aroL and aroK genes were deleted, and the aroB, aroG*, ppsA, and tktA genes were overexpressed. The relative amount of shikimic acid that accumulated in SK4/rpsM was 1.28-fold higher than that in SK4/pLac. Furthermore, a novel shikimic acid production pathway, combining the expression of the dehydroquinate dehydratase-shikimate dehydrogenase (DHQ-SDH) enzyme from woody plants, was constructed in E. coli strains. The results demonstrated that a growth phase-dependent control of the aroK gene leads to higher SA accumulation (5.33 g/L) in SK5/pSK6. This novel design can achieve higher shikimic acid production by using the same amount of medium used by the current methods and can also be widely used for modifying other metabolic pathways."
Efficient production of succinic acid in engineered Escherichia coli strains controlled by anaerobically-induced nirB promoter using sweet potato waste hydrolysate,"Huang, M., et al.",J Environ Manage,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.02.041,"Succinic acid has attracted interest worldwide as a precursor of many industrially crucial chemicals. Biosynthesis of succinic acid from biomass is developing as an environmentally friendly strategy now. Conversion of sweet potato waste (SPW) to succinic acid could implement high-value utilization of biomass, cut cost of the fermentation process and reduce the pollution of environment. Engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain HD134 under the control of anaerobically-induced nirB promoter from Salmonella enterica (P(SnirB)) could produce about 16.30â¯g/L succinic acid with a yield of 0.83â¯g/g after 48â¯h on glucose. With SPW hydrolysate as the substrate, 18.65â¯g/L succinic acid with a yield of 0.94â¯g/g after 48â¯h fermentation achieved. Compared to SD134 under Trc control induced with Isopropyl beta-D-Thiogalactoside (IPTG), this concentration and yield represented an 8.56% and 6.82% increase, respectively. The use of anaerobically-induced P(SnirB) not only could attain higher production of succinic acid than IPTG-induced Trc promoter, but omit cost of expensive exogenous inducers. The efficient production of succinic acid from SPW was firstly studied by anaerobically-induced P(SnirB) control, which achieved relative lower cost compared to glucose as substrate and IPTG as the inducer. This novel fermentation process conduces to the cosmically industrial succinic acid bioproduction."
Engineered Escherichia coli cell factory for anthranilate over-production,"Kim, H. J., et al.",Front Microbiol,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1081221,"Anthranilate is a key platform chemical in high demand for synthesizing food ingredients, dyes, perfumes, crop protection compounds, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. Microbial-based anthranilate production strategies have been developed to overcome the unstable and expensive supply of anthranilate via chemical synthesis from non-renewable resources. Despite the reports of anthranilate biosynthesis in several engineered cells, the anthranilate production yield is still unsatisfactory. This study designed an Escherichia coli cell factory and optimized the fed-batch culture process to achieve a high titer of anthranilate production. Using the previously constructed shikimate-overproducing E. coli strain, two genes (aroK and aroL) were complemented, and the trpD responsible for transferring the phosphoribosyl group to anthranilate was disrupted to facilitate anthranilate accumulation. The genes with negative effects on anthranilate biosynthesis, including pheA, tyrA, pabA, ubiC, entC, and trpR, were disrupted. In contrast, several shikimate biosynthetic pathway genes, including aroE and tktA, were overexpressed to maximize glucose uptake and the intermediate flux. The rationally designed anthranilate-overproducing E. coli strain grown in an optimized medium produced approximately 4 g/L of anthranilate in 7-L fed-batch fermentation. Overall, rational cell factory design and culture process optimization for microbial-based anthranilate production will play a key role in complementing traditional chemical-based anthranilate production processes."

In this study, the effect of two ethanol consumption pathways on 3-HP synthesis were studied as well as the effect of TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis pathway, and transhydrogenase. And the 3-HP synthesis pathway was also optimized. The engineered strain synthesized 1.66 g/L of 3-HP with a yield of 0.24 g/g. Furthermore, the titer and the yield of 3-HP increased to 13.17 g/L and 0.57 g/g in the whole-cell biocatalysis system. This study indicated that ethanol as feedstock had the potential to synthesize 3-HP, which provided an alternative route for future biorefinery."
Heat sensitization of Escherichia coli by the natural antimicrobials vanillin and emulsified citral in blended carrot-orange juice,"Orizano-Ponce, E., et al.",Food Microbiol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2022.104058,"Efforts have been focusing on the way to overcome the impact of heating on food quality while achieving the desired shelf life. In this sense, the thermosensitization of E. coli using the natural antimicrobials vanillin (V 0.8 and 1.0 g/L) or/and emulsified citral (C 0.012 and 0.025 g/L) was assessed at 58 and 60 degrees C in blended carrot-orange juice (pH 4.0 9.0 degrees Brix). All combined treatments exceeded the inactivation achieved by the single thermal treatments in half the time. The inactivation of the binary treatments (V or C + heating) at 58 degrees C was 3.84-0.62 log-cycles more effective than the control, particularly with vanillin. Ternary treatments (V + C + heating) at 58 degrees C increased the microbial reduction approximately 30% however, at 60 degrees C no further inactivation was observed, suggesting the thermal effect prevailed. This was verified by the higher b Weibullian parameter and the narrower frequency distributions. The selected treatments 1.0 V + 0.012C at 58 and 60 degrees C were challenged against the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 and found to be effective. Additionally, the microbiota of the juice was maintained at acceptable levels during storage (4 degrees C). In conclusion, there was an increase in the heat sensitivity of E. coli due to the natural antimicrobials, particularly vanillin at 58 degrees C. Therefore, reducing the intensity of the thermal processing will lead to clean label, high-quality juices, while addressing food safety requirements."
Simple amino acid tags improve both expression and secretion of Candida antarctica lipase B in recombinant Escherichia coli,"Kim, S. K., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.25361,"Escherichia coli is the best-established microbial host strain for production of proteins and chemicals, but has a weakness for not secreting high amounts of active heterologous proteins to the extracellular culture medium, of which origins belong to whether prokaryotes or eukaryotes. In this study, Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB), a popular eukaryotic enzyme which catalyzes a number of biochemical reactions and barely secreted extracellularly, was expressed functionally at a gram scale in culture medium by using a simple amino acid-tag system of E. coli. New fusion tag systems consisting of a pelB signal sequence and various anion amino acid tags facilitated both intracellular expression and extracellular secretion of CalB. Among them, the N-terminal five aspartate tag changed the quaternary structure of the dimeric CalB and allowed production of 1.9 g/L active CalB with 65 U/mL activity in culture medium, which exhibited the same enzymatic properties as the commercial CalB. This PelB-anion amino acid tag-based expression system for CalB can be extended to production of other industrial proteins hardly expressed and exported from E. coli, thereby increasing target protein concentrations and minimizing purification steps."

The in vivo assay showed that rAT-INS had a higher activity in prolonging the bleeding time in mice than native-insulin. The purified rAT-INS had almost no insulin receptor binding activity. Our study demonstrates the promise for mass production of novel recombinant antiplatelet agents."
Development of Processes for Recombinant L-Asparaginase II Production by Escherichia coli Bl21 (De3): From Shaker to Bioreactors,"Barros, T., et al.",Pharmaceutics,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13010014,"Since 1961, L-asparaginase has been used to treat patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. It rapidly depletes the plasma asparagine and deprives the blood cells of this circulating amino acid, essential for the metabolic cycles of cells. In the search for viable alternatives to produce L-asparaginase, this work aimed to produce this enzyme from Escherichia coli in a shaker and in a 3 L bioreactor. Three culture media were tested: defined, semi-defined and complex medium. L-asparaginase activity was quantified using the beta-hydroxamate aspartic acid method. The defined medium provided the highest L-asparaginase activity. In induction studies, two inducers, lactose and its analog IPTG, were compared. Lactose was chosen as an inducer for the experiments conducted in the bioreactor due to its natural source, lower cost and lower toxicity. Batch and fed-batch cultures were carried out to reach high cell density and then start the induction. Batch cultivation provided a final cell concentration of 11 g L(-1) and fed-batch cultivation produced 69.90 g L(-1) of cells, which produced a volumetric activity of 43,954.79 U L(-1) after lactose induction. L-asparaginase was produced in a shaker and scaled up to a bioreactor, increasing 23-fold the cell concentration and thus, the enzyme productivity."
Large-scale manufacture of VP2 VLP vaccine against porcine parvovirus in Escherichia coli with high-density fermentation,"Wang, J., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10483-5,"Porcine parvovirus (PPV) virus-like particles (VLPs) are a potential vaccine candidate for the prevention of parvovirus-induced reproductive failure in pregnant sows. Currently, the Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system is the most cost-efficient to express recombinant proteins. To overcome the limitations of protein misfolding and to prepare soluble highly bioactive antigen and high yields of protein, we optimized the PPV-VP2 gene, subcloned it into pET24a, pET26b, pET28a, and pET30a, and transformed it into E. coli BL21(DE3)-Tf16 competent cells. The pET28a plasmid was selected for further manipulations because it expressed high levels of the bioactive PPV-VP2 protein. Under optimal high-density fermenting conditions in a 70-L fermenter, the total yield of wet weight E. coli cells was 124.86 g/L, and PPV-VP2 protein was 2.5 g/L. After large-scale purification with Triton X-114 two-phase extraction as well as activated carbon powder adsorption, hemagglutination (HA) titers in the purified PPV-VP2 protein reached 2(19) and endotoxin was reduced to 2500 EU/mL. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results indicated that the purified PPV-VP2 protein self-assembled into VLPs. Immunogenicity assays in guinea pigs and pigs indicated that the ISA-201 VG adjuvanted PPV-VP2 VLP vaccine elicited hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) antibody titers comparable with PPV commercial inactivated vaccines, whereas viral loads in the spleen and liver of challenged guinea pigs were significantly reduced. In conclusion, our study provides a method for producing the PPV-VLP vaccine against PPV infection in E. coli and may offer a novel strategy for the soluble expression of other vaccine antigens."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid using xylose,"Zhao, A., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8162-3,"Biomass-derived xylose is an economically interesting substrate for the sustainable microbial production of value-added compounds. Escherichia coli could barely use xylose to directly produce gamma-aminobutyric acid. In this study, E. coli strains that could directly produce gamma-aminobutyric acid were developed through the deletion of eight genes sucA, puuE, gabT, gabP, xylA, xylB, waaC, and waaF, and the overexpression of two E. coli genes gadB and gdhA, as well as five Caulobacter crescent genes CcxylA, CcxylB, CcxylC, CcxylD, and CcxylX. Both E. coli strains W3110 and JM109 could directly produce gamma-aminobutyric acid from xylose after either overexpression of the seven genes or deletion of the eight genes. Overexpression of the seven genes of in the multiple deletion mutants further increased gamma-aminobutyric acid production. Among the 28 recombinant E. coli strains constructed in this study, the highest gamma-aminobutyric acid was produced by JWZ08/pWZt7-g3/pWZt7-xyl. JWZ08/pWZt7-g3/pWZt7-xyl could produce 3.95 g/L gamma-aminobutyric acid in flask cultivation, using xylose as the sole carbon source."

Xian",Biotechnol Lett,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0638-0,"Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered using a new host-vector system to produce phloroglucinol. The key biosynthetic gene phlD (encoding a type III polyketide synthase) from Pseudomonas fluorescens was expressed in E. coli using the stationary-phase promoter of the fic gene and a high-copy plasmid. In shake-flasks, the engineered strain produced phloroglucinol up to 0.28 g/l with a productivity of 0.014 g/l h. About 9.2% of the glucose consumed was converted to phloroglucinol after 20 h. Compared with the widely used inducible T7 promoter system, this strain did not require IPTG induction and the final titer of phloroglucinol was 22% higher."
Efficient secretion of an enzyme cocktail in Escherichia coli for hemicellulose degradation,"Zhang, S., et al.",Int J Biol Macromol,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.129205,"The use of host to secrete several hemicellulase is a cost-effective way for hemicellulose degradation. In this study, the xylose utilization gene xylAB of Escherichia coli BL21 was knocked out, and the xylanase (N20Xyl), beta-xylosidase (Xys), and feruloyl esterase (FaeLam) were co-expressed in this strain. By measuring the content of reducing sugars generated by enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat bran in the fermentation supernatant, the order of the three enzymes was screened to obtain the optimal recombinant strain of E. coli BL21/âxylAB/pDIII-2. Subsequently, fermentation conditions including culture medium, inducer concentration, induction timing, metal ions, and glycine concentration were optimized. Then, different concentrations of wheat bran and xylan were added to the fermentation medium for degradation. The results showed that the extracellular reducing sugars content reached the highest value of 33.70 +/- 0.46 g/L when 50 g/L xylan was added. Besides, the scavenging rates of hydroxyl radical by the fermentation supernatant was 81.0 +/- 1.41 %, and the total antioxidant capacity reached 2.289 +/- 0.55. Furthermore, it showed the growth promotion effect on different lactic acid bacteria. These results provided a basis for constructing E. coli strain to efficiently degrade hemicellulose, and the strain obtained has great potential application to transform hemicellulose into fermentable carbon source."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of benzoic acid from glucose,"Luo, Z. W. and S. Y. Lee",Metab Eng,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.10.002,"Benzoic acid (BA) is an important platform aromatic compound in chemical industry and is widely used as food preservatives in its salt forms. Yet, current manufacture of BA is dependent on petrochemical processes under harsh conditions. Here we report the de novo production of BA from glucose using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains harboring a plant-like beta-oxidation pathway or a newly designed synthetic pathway. First, three different natural BA biosynthetic pathways originated from plants and one synthetically designed pathway were systemically assessed for BA production from glucose by in silico flux response analyses. The selected plant-like beta-oxidation pathway and the synthetic pathway were separately established in E. coli by expressing the genes encoding the necessary enzymes and screened heterologous enzymes under optimal plasmid configurations. BA production was further optimized by applying several metabolic engineering strategies to the engineered E. coli strains harboring each metabolic pathway, which included enhancement of the precursor availability, removal of competitive reactions, transporter engineering, and reduction of byproduct formation. Lastly, fed-batch fermentations of the final engineered strain harboring the beta-oxidation pathway and the strain harboring the synthetic pathway were conducted, which resulted in the production of 2.37 +/- 0.02 g/L and 181.0 +/- 5.8 mg/L of BA from glucose, respectively the former being the highest titer reported by microbial fermentation. The metabolic engineering strategies developed here will be useful for the production of related aromatics of high industrial interest."
Structure-guided reshaping of the acyl binding pocket of 'TesA thioesterase enhances octanoic acid production in E. coli,"Deng, X., et al.",Metab Eng,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.04.010,"Medium-chain fatty acids (C6-C10) have attracted much attention recently for their unique properties compared to their long-chain counterparts, including low melting points and relatively higher carbon conversion yield. Thioesterase enzymes, which can catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) to release free fatty acids (FAs), regulate both overall FA yields and acyl chain length distributions in bacterial and yeast fermentation cultures. These enzymes typically prefer longer chain substrates. Herein, seeking to increase bacterial production of MCFAs, we conducted structure-guided mutational screening of multiple residues in the substrate-binding pocket of the E. coli thioesterase enzyme 'TesA. Confirming our hypothesis that enhancing substrate selectivity for medium-chain acyl substrates would promote overall MCFA production, we found that replacement of residues lining the bottom of the pocket with more hydrophobic residues strongly promoted the C8 substrate selectivity of 'TesA. Specifically, two rounds of saturation mutagenesis led to the identification of the 'TesA(RD-2) variant that exhibited a 133-fold increase in selectivity for the C8-ACP substrate as compared to C16-ACP substrate. Moreover, the recombinant expression of this variant in an E. coli strain with a blocked beta-oxidation pathway led to a 1030% increase in the in vivo octanoic acid (C8) production titer. When this strain was fermented in a 5-L fed-batch bioreactor, it produced 2.7 g/L of free C8 (45%, molar fraction) and 7.9 g/L of total free FAs, which is the highest-to-date free C8 titer to date reported using the E. coli type II fatty acid synthetic pathway. Thus, reshaping the substrate binding pocket of a bacterial thioesterase enzyme by manipulating the hydrophobicity of multiple residues altered the substrate selectivity and therefore fatty acid product distributions in cells. Our study demonstrates the relevance of this strategy for increasing titers of industrially attractive MCFAs as fermentation products."
Engineering Escherichia coli for succinate production from hemicellulose via consolidated bioprocessing,"Zheng, Z., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-11-37,"BACKGROUND: The recalcitrant nature of hemicellulosic materials and the high cost in depolymerization are the primary obstacles preventing the use of xylan as feedstock for fuel and chemical production. Consolidated bioprocessing, incorporating enzyme-generating, biomass-degrading and bioproduct-producing capabilities into a single microorganism, could potentially avoid the cost of the dedicated enzyme generation in the process of xylan utilization. In this study, we engineered Escherichia coli strains capable of exporting three hemicellulases to the broth for the succinate production directly from beechwood xylan. RESULTS: Xylanases were extracellular environment-directed by fusing with OsmY. Subsequently, twelve variant OsmY fused endoxylanase-xylosidase combinations were characterized and tested. The combination of XynC-A from Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and XyloA from Fusarium graminearum which appeared to have optimal enzymatic properties was identified as the best choice for xylan hydrolysis (0.18 +/- 0.01 g/l protein in the broth with endoxylanase activity of 12.14 +/- 0.34 U/mg protein and xylosidase activity of 92 +/- 3 mU/mg protein at 8 h after induction). Further improvements of hemicellulases secretion were investigated by lpp deletion, dsbA overexpression and expression level optimization. With co-expression of alpha-arabinofuranosidase, the engineered E. coli could hydrolyze beechwood xylan to pentose monosaccharides. The hemicellulolytic capacity was further integrated with a succinate-producing strain to demonstrate the production of succinate directly from xylan without externally supplied hydrolases and any other organic nutrient. The resulting E. coli Z6373 was able to produce 0.37 g/g succinate from xylan anaerobically equivalent to 76% of that from xylan acid hydrolysates. CONCLUSIONS: This report represents a promising step towards the goal of hemicellulosic chemical production. This engineered E. coli expressing and secreting three hemicellulases demonstrated a considerable succinate production on the released monosaccharides from xylan. The ability to use lower-cost crude feedstock will make biological succinate production more economically attractive."
Efficient soluble expression of disulfide bonded proteins in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli in fed-batch fermentations on chemically defined minimal media,"Gaciarz, A., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-017-0721-x,"BACKGROUND: The production of recombinant proteins containing disulfide bonds in Escherichia coli is challenging. In most cases the protein of interest needs to be either targeted to the oxidizing periplasm or expressed in the cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies, then solubilized and re-folded in vitro. Both of these approaches have limitations. Previously we showed that soluble expression of disulfide bonded proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli is possible at shake flask scale with a system, known as CyDisCo, which is based on co-expression of a protein of interest along with a sulfhydryl oxidase and a disulfide bond isomerase. With CyDisCo it is possible to produce disulfide bonded proteins in the presence of intact reducing pathways in the cytoplasm. RESULTS: Here we scaled up production of four disulfide bonded proteins to stirred tank bioreactors and achieved high cell densities and protein yields in glucose fed-batch fermentations, using an E. coli strain (BW25113) with the cytoplasmic reducing pathways intact. Even without process optimization production of purified human single chain IgA(1) antibody fragment reached 139 mg/L and hen avidin 71 mg/L, while purified yields of human growth hormone 1 and interleukin 6 were around 1 g/L. Preliminary results show that human growth hormone 1 was also efficiently produced in fermentations of W3110 strain and when glucose was replaced with glycerol as the carbon source. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that efficient production of high yields of soluble disulfide bonded proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli with the reducing pathways intact is feasible to scale-up to bioreactor cultivations on chemically defined minimal media."
Enhanced production of recombinant Escherichia coli glutamate decarboxylase through optimization of induction strategy and addition of pyridoxine,"Su, L., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.153,"This report describes the optimization of recombinant Escherichia coli glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) production from engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) in a 3-L fermentor. Investigation of different induction strategies revealed that induction was optimal when the temperature was maintained at 30 degrees C, the inducer (lactose) was fed at a rate of 0.2 g L(-1)h(-1), and protein expression was induced when the cell density (OD600) reached 50. Under these conditions, the GAD activity of 1273.8 U mL(-1) was achieved. Because GAD is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, the effect of supplementing the medium with pyridoxine hydrochloride (PN), a cheap and stable PLP precursor, on GAD production was also investigated. When the culture medium was supplemented with PN to a concentration of 2mM at the initiation of protein expression, and then again 10h later, the GAD activity reached 3193.4 U mL(-1), which represented the highest GAD production ever reported."
Constitutive expression of the sRNA GadY decreases acetate production and improves E. coli growth,"Negrete, A. and J. Shiloach",Microb Cell Fact,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-015-0334-1,"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli responds to acid stress by applying various physiological, metabolic, and proton-consuming mechanisms depending on the growth media composition, cell density, growth phase, pH, and aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions. It was reported that at mild acidic conditions (pH 5.8), the Hfq-associated sRNA GadY is activated. It was also reported that the two decarboxylase systems-the lysine decarboxylase system (LDS) and the glutamate decarboxylase system (GDS)-are activated to maintain intracellular balance of protons. The purpose of this study was to establish the role of GadY in high density growth of E. coli and to evaluate the possibility of using this small RNA to create an acid-resistant strain suitable for industrial applications. RESULTS: Parental E. coli K-12 and constitutively expressing GadY strains were grown to high cell densities in a bioreactor at pH 7.0 and pH 6.0. At pH 7.0, both strains grew to similar cell densities of 43 OD, but the constitutively expressing GadY strain produced around 6 g/L acetate compared with 10 g/L by the parental strain. At pH 6.0, the parental strain grew to an OD of 20 and produced 10 g/L of acetate while the GadY strain grew to an average OD of 31 and produced 4 g/L acetate. After analyzing 17 genes associated with acid stress, it was found that at pH 7.0 LDS was expressed in the early exponential phase and GDS was expressed in the late exponential phase in both strains. However, at pH.6.0, GDS was expressed in the late exponential phase only in the parental strain and not in the constitutively expressing GadY strain, while there was no difference in the LDS expression pattern it was expressed in the early exponential phase in both strains. This indicates that GadY affects GDS expression at low pH since the GDS was not detected in the GadY strain at pH 6.0. CONCLUSIONS: The constitutive expression of GadY improves E. coli growth at pH 6.0 by deactivating the expression of the GDS in the late exponential growth phase. The expression of GadY also decreases acetate production regardless of pH, which decreases the inhibitory effect of this acid on bacterial growth."
Efficient Production of Lactobionic Acid Using Escherichia coli Capable of Synthesizing Pyrroloquinoline Quinone,"Han, H. J., et al.",J Agric Food Chem,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08010,"Lactobionic acid (LBA) is an emerging chemical that has been widely utilized in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. We sought to produce LBA using Escherichia coli. LBA can be produced from lactose in E. coli, which is innately unable to produce LBA, by coexpressing a heterologous quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and a pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) synthesis gene cluster. Using a recombinant E. coli strain, we successfully produced LBA without additional supplementation of PQQ, and changing the type of heterologous GDH improved the LBA production titer and productivity. To further enhance LBA production, culture conditions, such as growth temperature and isopropyl-beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside concentration, were optimized. Using optimized culture conditions, batch fermentation of the recombinant E. coli strain was performed using a 5 L bioreactor. After fermentation, this strain produced an LBA titer of 209.3 g/L, a yield of 100%, and a productivity of 1.45 g/L/h. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to produce LBA using heterologous GDH in an E. coli strain without any additional cofactors. Our results provide a simple method to produce LBA from lactose in a naturally non-LBA-producing bacterium and lay the groundwork for highly efficient LBA production in E. coli, which is one of the most versatile metabolite-producing bacterial hosts."
Using Unnatural Protein Fusions to Engineer a Coenzyme Self-Sufficiency System for D-Phenyllactic Acid Biosynthesis in Escherichia coli,"Qin, Z., et al.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2021.795885,"The biosynthetic production of D-penyllactic acid (D-PLA) is often affected by insufficient supply and regeneration of cofactors, leading to high production cost, and difficulty in industrialization. In this study, a D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) and glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyDH) co-expression system was constructed to achieve coenzyme NADH self-sufficiency and sustainable production of D-PLA. Using glycerol and sodium phenylpyruvate (PPA) as co-substrate, the E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring a plasmid to co-express LfD-LDH and BmGlyDH produced 3.95 g/L D-PLA with a yield of 0.78 g/g PPA, similar to previous studies. Then, flexible linkers were used to construct fusion proteins composing of D-LDH and GlyDH. Under the optimal conditions, 5.87 g/L D-PLA was produced by expressing LfD-LDH-l(3)-BmGlyDH with a yield of 0.97 g/g PPA, which was 59.3% increased compared to expression of LfD-LDH. In a scaled-up reaction, a productivity of 5.83 g/L/h was reached. In this study, improving the bio-catalytic efficiency by artificial redox self-equilibrium system with a bifunctional fusion protein could reduce the bio-production cost of D-PLA, making this bio-production of D-PLA a more promising industrial technology."
Heterologous expression and purification of a marine alginate lyase in Escherichia coli,"Sun, X., et al.",Protein Expr Purif,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2018.09.002,"Alginate lyase digestion is an efficient way to degrade alginate into oligosaccharides, which are useful in various areas including chemistry, pharmacy and food industry.

We improved its secretion efficiency by replacing the original secretive sequence by E. coli specific signal peptide ompA. We successfully purified the full-length protein in shake flask culture, however, degradation happened during fed batch cultivation. By domain and disorder examination, we found that the protein was completely functional by expressing the C terminal fragment alone. For the final strain we constructed (HMS-ompA-CF), the extracellular enzyme activity reached 375 U/ml in shake flask and 1789 U/ml in fed batch cultivation (5â¯L bioreactor). And the final protein yield reached 0.58â¯g/L in fed batch cultivation. We determined that the optimal pH and temperature for the shortened alginate lyase were 7.0 and 39â¯ degrees C, respectively."
Effect of anaerobic promoters on the microaerobic production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in recombinant Escherichia coli,"Wei, X. X., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-008-1816-4,"Nine anaerobic promoters were cloned and constructed upstream of PHB synthesis genes phbCAB from Ralstonia eutropha for the micro- or anaerobic PHB production in recombinant Escherichia coli. Among the promoters, the one for alcohol dehydrogenase (PadhE) was found most effective. Recombinant E. coli JM 109 (pWCY09) harboring PadhE and phbCAB achieved a 48% PHB accumulation in the cell dry weight after 48 h of static culture compared with only 30% PHB production under its native promoter. Sixty-seven percent PHB was produced in the dry weight (CDW) of an acetate pathway deleted (Deltapta deletion) E. coli JW2294 harboring the vector pWCY09. In a batch process conducted in a 5.5-l NBS fermentor containing 3 l glucose LB medium, E. coli JW2294 (pWCY09) grew to 7.8 g/l CDW containing 64% PHB after 24 h of microaerobic incubation. In addition, molecular weight of PHB was observed to be much higher under microaerobic culture conditions. The high activity of PadhE appeared to be the reason for improved micro- or anaerobic cell growth and PHB production while high molecular weight contributed to the static culture condition."
Enhancement of L-phenylalanine production by engineered Escherichia coli using phased exponential L-tyrosine feeding combined with nitrogen source optimization,"Yuan, P., et al.",J Biosci Bioeng,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.12.002,"Nitrogen source optimization combined with phased exponential L-tyrosine feeding was employed to enhance L-phenylalanine production by a tyrosine-auxotroph strain, Escherichia coli YP1617. The absence of (NH4)2SO4, the use of corn steep powder and yeast extract as composite organic nitrogen source were more suitable for cell growth and L-phenylalanine production. Moreover, the optimal initial L-tyrosine level was 0.3 g L(-1) and exponential L-tyrosine feeding slightly improved L-phenylalanine production. Nerveless, L-phenylalanine production was greatly enhanced by a strategy of phased exponential L-tyrosine feeding, where exponential feeding was started at the set specific growth rate of 0.08, 0.05, and 0.02 h(-1) after 12, 32, and 52 h, respectively. Compared with exponential L-tyrosine feeding at the set specific growth rate of 0.08 h(-1), the developed strategy obtained a 15.33% increase in L-phenylalanine production (L-phenylalanine of 56.20 g L(-1)) and a 45.28% decrease in L-tyrosine supplementation."
Co-expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase for succinate production in engineered Escherichia coli,"Jiang, M., et al.",Enzyme Microb Technol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.12.011,"Succinate is not the dominant fermentation product from xylose in wild-type Escherichia coli K12. E. coli BA 203 is a lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-carboxylase (ppc) deletion strain. To increase succinate accumulation and reduce byproduct formation, engineered E. coli BA204, in which ATP-forming PEP-carboxykinase (PEPCK) is overexpressed in BA203, was constructed and produced 2.17-fold higher succinate yield. To further improve the biomass and the consumption rate of xylose, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase), a rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of NAD(H), was also overexpressed. Thus, co-expression of PEPCK and NAPRTase in recombinant E. coli BA209 was investigated. In BA209, the pck gene and the pncB gene each have a trc promoter, hence, both genes are well expressed. During a 72-h anaerobic fermentation in sealed bottles, the total concentration of NAD(H) in BA209 was 1.25-fold higher than that in BA204, and the NADH/NAD+ ratio decreased from 0.28 to 0.11. During the exclusively anaerobic fermentation in a 3-L bioreactor, BA209 consumed 17.1 g L(-)(1) xylose and produced 15.5 g L(-)(1) succinate. Furthermore, anaerobic fermentation of corn stalk hydrolysate contained 30.1 g L(-)(1) xylose, 2.1 g L(-)(1) glucose and 1.5 g L(-)(1) arabinose, it produced a final succinate concentration of 17.2 g L(-)(1) with a yield of 0.94 g g(-)(1) total sugars."
Bioconversion of distillers' grains hydrolysates to advanced biofuels by an Escherichia coli co-culture,"Liu, F., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-017-0804-8,"BACKGROUND: First generation bioethanol production utilizes the starch fraction of maize, which accounts for approximately 60% of the ash-free dry weight of the grain. Scale-up of this technology for fuels applications has resulted in a massive supply of distillers' grains with solubles (DGS) coproduct, which is rich in cellulosic polysaccharides and protein. It was surmised that DGS would be rapidly adopted for animal feed applications, however, this has not been observed based on inconsistency of the product stream and other logistics-related risks, especially toxigenic contaminants. Therefore, efficient valorization of DGS for production of petroleum displacing products will significantly improve the techno-economic feasibility and net energy return of the established starch bioethanol process. In this study, we demonstrate 'one-pot' bioconversion of the protein and carbohydrate fractions of a DGS hydrolysate into C4 and C5 fusel alcohols through development of a microbial consortium incorporating two engineered Escherichia coli biocatalyst strains. RESULTS: The carbohydrate conversion strain E. coli BLF2 was constructed from the wild type E. coli strain B and showed improved capability to produce fusel alcohols from hexose and pentose sugars. Up to 12 g/L fusel alcohols was produced from glucose or xylose synthetic medium by E. coli BLF2. The second strain, E. coli AY3, was dedicated for utilization of proteins in the hydrolysates to produce mixed C4 and C5 alcohols. To maximize conversion yield by the co-culture, the inoculation ratio between the two strains was optimized. The co-culture with an inoculation ratio of 1:1.5 of E. coli BLF2 and AY3 achieved the highest total fusel alcohol titer of up to 10.3 g/L from DGS hydrolysates. The engineered E. coli co-culture system was shown to be similarly applicable for biofuel production from other biomass sources, including algae hydrolysates. Furthermore, the co-culture population dynamics revealed by quantitative PCR analysis indicated that despite the growth rate difference between the two strains, co-culturing didn't compromise the growth of each strain. The q-PCR analysis also demonstrated that fermentation with an appropriate initial inoculation ratio of the two strains was important to achieve a balanced co-culture population which resulted in higher total fuel titer. CONCLUSIONS: The efficient conversion of DGS hydrolysates into fusel alcohols will significantly improve the feasibility of the first generation bioethanol process. The integrated carbohydrate and protein conversion platform developed here is applicable for the bioconversion of a variety of biomass feedstocks rich in sugars and proteins."
Enhanced Phenyllactic Acid Production in Escherichia coli Via Oxygen Limitation and Shikimate Pathway Gene Expression,"Kawaguchi, H., et al.",Biotechnol J,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201800478,"3-Phenyllactic acid (PhLA) is useful as a start-up material in the pharmaceutical and biorefinery industries. To enhance the production of PhLA from glucose using recombinant Escherichia coli, the effects of glucose concentration and oxygen limitation on PhLA production are assessed in a fed-batch system using dissolved oxygen (DO)-stat method. The highest titer of PhLA (7.3 g L(-1) ) is observed with a high concentration of glucose and under oxygen-limited conditions (DO = 0 ppm). Under oxygen limitation, cell growth and the formation of acetate and l-phenylalanine (Phe) by-products after 72 h of cultivation are reduced by 30%, 70%, and 81%, respectively, as compared to that under high DO conditions (DO = 5 ppm). Gene expression levels are compared between low and high DO conditions by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Several genes in the glycolysis (gapA and pykA), pentose phosphate (tktA), and early shikimate pathways for PhLA biosynthesis (aroF, aroG, and aroH) are upregulated under oxygen limitation. The results suggest that oxygen limitation affects metabolism in the shikimate pathway at both metabolic and transcriptional levels and that controlling the DO level is critical for enhanced production of a variety of aromatic compounds through the shikimate pathway."
Enhancing E. coli isobutanol tolerance through engineering its global transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP),"Chong, H., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.25134,"The limited isobutanol tolerance of Escherichia coli is a major drawback during fermentative isobutanol production. Different from classical strain engineering approaches, this work was initiated to improve E. coli isobutanol tolerance from its transcriptional level by engineering its global transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP). Random mutagenesis libraries were generated by error-prone PCR of crp, and the libraries were subjected to isobutanol stress for selection. Variant IB2 (S179P, H199R) was isolated and exhibited much better growth (0.18 h(-1) ) than the control (0.05 h(-1) ) in 1.2% (v/v) isobutanol (9.6 g/L). Genome-wide DNA microarray analysis revealed that 58 and 308 genes in IB2 had differential expression (>2-fold, p < 0.05) in the absence and presence of 1% (v/v) isobutanol, respectively. When challenged with isobutanol, genes related to acid resistance (gadABCE, hdeABD), nitrate reduction (narUZYWV), flagella and fimbrial activity (lfhA, yehB, ycgR, fimCDF), and sulfate reduction and transportation (cysIJH, cysC, cysN) were the major functional groups that were up-regulated, whereas most of the down-regulated genes were enzyme (tnaA) and transporters (proVWX, manXYZ). As demonstrated by single-gene knockout experiments, gadX, nirB, rhaS, hdeB, and ybaS were found associated with strain isobutanol resistance. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in IB2 was only half of that of the control when facing stress, indicating that IB2 can withstand toxic isobutanol much better than the control."
Cloning Rosa hybrid phenylacetaldehyde synthase for the production of 2-phenylethanol in a whole cell Escherichia coli system,"Achmon, Y., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5269-z,"2-Phenylethanol (2-PE) is a desirable compound in the food and perfumery industries with a characteristic rose fragrance. Until now, most of the studied biotechnological processes to produce 2-PE were conducted using natural 2-PE-producing yeasts. Only several researches were conducted in other genetically engineered microorganisms that simulated the Ehrlich pathway for the conversion of amino acids to fusel alcohols. Here, a novel metabolic pathway has been designed in Escherichia coli to produce 2-PE, using the Rosa hybrid phenylacetaldehyde synthase (PAAS), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme capable of transforming L-phenylalanine (L-phe) into phenylacetaldehyde by decarboxylation and oxidation. To overcome the enzyme insolubility in E. coli, several plasmids and host strains were tested for their expression ability. The desired results were obtained by using the pTYB21 plasmid containing the intein tag from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA1. It was discovered that the intein PAAS activity is temperature-dependent, working well in the range of 25 to 30 degrees C but losing most of its activity at 37 degrees C. When external PLP cofactor was added, the cells produced 0.39 g l(-)(1) 2-PE directly from L-phe. In addition, a biotransformation that was based only on internal de novo PLP synthesis produced 0.34 g l(-)(1) 2-PE, thus creating for the first time an E. coli strain that can produce 2-PE from L-phe without the need for exterior cofactor additions."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) from glucose,"Yang, J. E., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5285-z,"The Escherichia coli XL1-blue strain was metabolically engineered to synthesize poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] through 2-ketobutyrate, which is generated via citramalate pathway, as a precursor for propionyl-CoA. Two different metabolic pathways were examined for the synthesis of propionyl-CoA from 2-ketobutyrate. The first pathway is composed of the Dickeya dadantii 3937 2-ketobutyrate oxidase or the E. coli pyruvate oxidase mutant (PoxB L253F V380A) for the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionate and the Ralstonia eutropha propionyl-CoA synthetase (PrpE) or the E. coli acetyl-CoA:acetoacetyl-CoA transferase for further conversion of propionate into propionyl-CoA. The second pathway employs pyruvate formate lyase encoded by the E. coli tdcE gene or the Clostridium difficile pflB gene for the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-CoA. As the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-CoA could not support the efficient production of P(3HB-co-3HV) from glucose, the first metabolic pathway was further examined. When the recombinant E. coli XL1-blue strain equipped with citramalate pathway expressing the E. coli poxB L253F V380A gene and R. eutropha prpE gene together with the R. eutropha PHA biosynthesis genes was cultured in a chemically defined medium containing 20 g/L of glucose as a sole carbon source, P(3HB-co-2.3 mol% 3HV) was produced up to the polymer content of 61.7 wt.%. Moreover, the 3HV monomer fraction in P(3HB-co-3HV) could be increased up to 5.5 mol% by additional deletion of the prpC and scpC genes, which are responsible for the metabolism of propionyl-CoA in host strains."
The properties of ZnO nanofluids and the role of H2O2 in the disinfection activity against Escherichia coli,"Zhang, L., et al.",Water Res,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.10.054,"This work investigates the disinfection property of ZnO nanofluids, focusing on H2O2 production and the disinfection activities of ZnO suspensions with different particles/aggregates. The possible disinfection mechanisms of ZnO suspensions are analysed. In this work, a medium mill was used to produce ZnO suspensions with different sizes of particles/aggregates. During the milling process, five ZnO suspension samples (A-E) were produced. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analyses revealed that after milling, the size of ZnO particles/aggregates in the suspensions decreased. Disinfection tests, H2O2 detection assays and fluorescent analyses were used to explore the disinfection activities and mechanism of ZnO suspensions. Disinfection tests results showed that all the produced ZnO suspension exhibited disinfection activity against Escherichia coli. ZnO suspensions with smaller particles/aggregates showed better disinfection activities. The presence of H2O2 in ZnO suspension was analysed. The H2O2 detection assay suggested that there is 1 muM H2O2 in 0.2 g/l ZnO Sample A, while there was no H2O2 present in ZnO Sample E. Though results showed that there was no H2O2 present in ZnO Sample E, Sample E with a size of 93 nm showed the best disinfection activities. Fluorescence tests detected that the interaction between E. coli lipid vesicles and ZnO Sample E was much faster and more efficient. This study firstly demonstrated that ZnO suspensions with different particles/aggregates produced different amount of H2O2. Results suggested that H2O2 is responsible for the disinfection activity of larger ZnO particles/aggregates while the interaction between smaller ZnO particles/aggregates and vesicle lipids is responsible for the disinfection activity of smaller ZnO particles/aggregates."

The half-life of immobilized cells was 1.52 times to that of free cells. Batch experiments showed that the enzyme activity of immobilized cells remained 70.5% of the initial activity after 10 batches and the space-time yield of xylitol reached of 11.5â¯g/(Lâ¯h).

"Inactivation of Escherichia coli in fresh water with advanced oxidation processes based on the combination of O3, H2O2, and TiO2. Kinetic modeling","Rodriguez-Chueca, J., et al.",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4222-3,"The purpose of this work was to study the efficiency of different treatments, based on the combination of O3, H2O2, and TiO2, on fresh surface water samples fortified with wild strains of Escherichia coli. Moreover, an exhaustive assessment of the influence of the different agents involved in the treatment has been carried out by kinetic modeling of E. coli inactivation results. The treatments studied were (i) ozonation (O3), (ii) the peroxone system (O3/0.04 mM H2O2), (iii) catalytic ozonation (O3/1 g/L TiO2), and (iv) a combined treatment of O3/1 g/L TiO2/0.04 mM H2O2. It was observed that the peroxone system achieved the highest levels of inactivation of E. coli, around 6.80 log after 10 min of contact time. Catalytic ozonation also obtained high levels of inactivation in a short period of time, reaching 6.22 log in 10 min. Both treatments, the peroxone system (O3/H2O2) and catalytic ozonation (O3/TiO2), produced a higher inactivation rate of E. coli than ozonation (4.97 log after 10 min). While the combination of ozone with hydrogen peroxide or titanium dioxide thus produces an increase in the inactivation yield of E. coli regarding ozonation, the O3/TiO2/H2O2 combination did not enhance the inactivation results. The fitting of experimental values to the corresponding equations through non-linear regression techniques was carried out with Microsoft(R) Excel GInaFiT software. The inactivation results of E. coli did not respond to linear functions, and it was necessary to use mathematical models able to describe certain deviations in the bacterial inactivation processes. In this case, the inactivation results fit with mathematical models based on the hypothesis that the bacteria population is divided into two different subgroups with different degrees of resistance to treatments, for instance biphasic and biphasic with shoulder models.

Simultaneous carbon dioxide sequestration and utilization for cadaverine production using dual promoters in engineered Escherichia coli strains,"Sri Wahyu Effendi, S., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.127980,"Human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) is a rapid-acting zinc-metalloenzyme that catalyzes CO(2) hydration reversibly, with encouraging applications in carbon capture, sequestration, and utilization (CCSU). However, biocatalyst durability is a major challenge. Herein, hCAII is emphasized in 4 different Escherichia coli strains and designated under dual promoters from sigma factor 70 (sigma(70)) and heat shock protein (HSP70A) to suppress the usage of inducer and stimulate activity in heat environments. As a result, hCAII under high-efficient dual promoters regulation retained high residual activity in CO(2) biomineralization of 68.8 % after 4 cycles at 40 degrees C. Moreover, co-expression of CA(C9) with lysine decarboxylase (CadA) simultaneously sequestered CO(2) release up to 95.7 % and increased cadaverine titer from 18.0 to 36.7 g/L by using E. coli MG1655. The remnant biomass from cadaverine synthesis sustained converting CO(2) to 57.9 mg-CaCO(3). Thus, the dual promoters design demonstrated the promising potential for CCSU through simultaneous CO(2) utilization and cadaverine synthesis."

Here, we describe the first strain of Escherichia coli developed to produce the higher alcohol and potential new biofuel 2-methyl-1-butanol (2MB). To accomplish this, we explored the biodiversity of enzymes catalyzing key parts of the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, finding that AHAS II (ilvGM) from Salmonella typhimurium and threonine deaminase (ilvA) from Corynebacterium glutamicum improve 2MB production the most. Overexpression of the native threonine biosynthetic operon (thrABC) on plasmid without the native transcription regulation also improved 2MB production in E. coli. Finally, we knocked out competing pathways upstream of threonine production (DeltametA, Deltatdh) to increase its availability for further improvement of 2MB production. This work led to a strain of E. coli that produces 1.25 g/L 2MB in 24 h, a total alcohol content of 3 g/L, and with yields of up to 0.17 g 2MB/g glucose."
Efficient production of 3-hydroxypropionate from fatty acids feedstock in Escherichia coli,"Liu, B., et al.",Metab Eng,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.10.003,"The production of chemicals from renewable biomass resources is usually limited by factors including high-cost processes and low efficiency of biosynthetic pathways. Fatty acids (FAs) are an ideal alternative biomass. Their advantages include high-efficiently producing acetyl-CoA and reducing power, coupling chemical production with CO(2) fixation, and the fact that they are readily obtained from inexpensive feedstocks. The important platform chemical 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) can be produced from FAs as the feedstock with a theoretical yield of 2.49â¯g/g, much higher than the theoretical yield from other feedstocks. In this study, we first systematically analyzed the limiting factors in FA-utilization pathways in Escherichia coli. Then, we optimized FA utilization in Escherichia coli by using a combination of metabolic engineering and optimization of fermentation conditions. The 3HP biosynthesis module was introduced into a FA-utilizing strain, and the flux balance was finely optimized to maximize 3HP production. The resulting strain was able to produce 3HP from FAs with a yield of 1.56â¯g/g, and was able to produce 3HP to a concentration of 52â¯g/L from FAs in a 5-L fermentation process. The strain also could produce 3HP from various type of FAs feedstock including gutter oil. This is the first report of a technique for the efficient production of the platform chemical 3HP from FAs."

We first constructed a pathway for 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, where metabolite profiling identified NudB, a promiscuous phosphatase, as a likely pathway bottleneck. We achieved a 60% increase in the yield of 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol by engineering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of nudB, which increased protein levels by 9-fold and reduced isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) accumulation by 4-fold. To further optimize the pathway, we adjusted mevalonate kinase (MK) expression and investigated MK enzymes from alternative microbes such as Methanosarcina mazei. Next, we expressed a fusion protein of IPP isomerase and the phosphatase (Idi1~NudB) along with a reductase (NemA) to diversify production to 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and 3-methyl-1-butanol. Finally, we used an oleyl alcohol overlay to improve alcohol recovery, achieving final titers of 2.23âg/L of 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (~70% of pathway-dependent theoretical yield), 150âmg/L of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and 300âmg/L of 3-methyl-1-butanol."

Cascades of miniaturized stirred-tank reactors were implemented, which enable the 24-fold parallel characterization of cascade processes and the direct scale-up of results to the liter scale. With PAmCherry concentrations of 1.15 g L(-1) cascades of stirred-tank reactors improved the process performance significantly compared to production processes in chemostats. In addition, an optimized fed-batch process was outperformed regarding space-time yield (149 mg L(-1) h(-1)).

In this study, we designed and experimentally verified a feasible non-natural synthesis pathway for the de novo production of 1,2-BDO from renewable carbohydrates for the first time. This pathway extends the l-threonine synthesis pathway by introducing two artificial metabolic modules to sequentially convert l-threonine into 2-hydroxybutyric acid and 1,2-BDO. Following key enzyme screening and enhancement of l-threonine synthesis module in the chassis microorganism, the best engineered Escherichia coli strain was able to produce 0.15 g/L 1,2-BDO using glucose as the sole carbon source.

To achieve the low-cost production of pseudouridine, Escherichia coli was systematically modified to utilize inexpensive raw materials to efficiently produce pseudouridine. First, in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, genes related to the precursor competing pathway and the negative regulator were deleted, which increased pseudouridine production. Second, two critical genes, pseudouridine-5'-phosphate glycosidase (psuG) and phosphatase genes from different bacteria, were screened and employed in various genetic constructs, and the pseudouridine yield of the optical strain increased to 599 mg/L. The accumulation of pseudouridine was further increased by the deletion of pseudouridine catabolism-related genes. Ultimately, the pseudouridine titer in a 5 L bioreactor reached 7.9 g/L, and the yield of pseudouridine on glucose was 0.15 g/g.

Cellulosic hydrolysate toxicity and tolerance mechanisms in Escherichia coli,"TY Mills, NR Sandoval, RT Gill",Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-2-26,"The sustainable production of biofuels will require the efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. A key barrier involves the creation of growth-inhibitory compounds by chemical pretreatment steps, which ultimately reduce the efficiency of fermentative microbial biocatalysts. The primary toxins include organic acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds. Weak acids enter the cell and dissociate, resulting in a drop in intracellular pH as well as various anion-specific effects on metabolism. Furan derivatives, dehydration products of hexose and pentose sugars, have been shown to hinder fermentative enzyme function. Phenolic compounds, formed from lignin, can disrupt membranes and are hypothesized to interfere with the function of intracellular hydrophobic targets. This review covers mechanisms of toxicity and tolerance for these compounds with a specific focus on the important industrial organism Escherichia coli.

The best chassis designed as JW, expressed the highest amount of CadA by using J23100 promoter, showing stable and high copy numbers (i.e., PCNâ¯>â¯100) when culture in the antibiotic-free medium. JW attained a CadA activity of 167 g-DAP/g-DCW-h and had the maximum biocatalyst of 45.6 g-DCW/L in fed-batch fermentation. In addition, JW was able to convert 2.5â¯M L-lysine to 221â¯g/L cadaverine, with 86 % yield and 55.3â¯g/L-h productivity. The whole-cell biocatalyst could be reused over four times at an average of 97 % conversion when supplied half of fresh cells in the reaction.

A process for microbial hydrocarbon synthesis: Overproduction of fatty acids in Escherichia coli and catalytic conversion to alkanes,"Lennen, R. M., et al.",Biotechnol Bioeng,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.22660,"The development of renewable alternatives to diesel and jet fuels is highly desirable for the heavy transportation sector, and would offer benefits over the production and use of short-chain alcohols for personal transportation. Here, we report the development of a metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli that overproduces medium-chain length fatty acids via three basic modifications: elimination of beta-oxidation, overexpression of the four subunits of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and expression of a plant acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase from Umbellularia californica (BTE). The expression level of BTE was optimized by comparing fatty acid production from strains harboring BTE on plasmids with four different copy numbers. Expression of BTE from low copy number plasmids resulted in the highest fatty acid production. Up to a seven-fold increase in total fatty acid production was observed in engineered strains over a negative control strain (lacking beta-oxidation), with a composition dominated by C(12) and C(14) saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Next, a strategy for producing undecane via a combination of biotechnology and heterogeneous catalysis is demonstrated. Fatty acids were extracted from a culture of an overproducing strain into an alkane phase and fed to a Pd/C plug flow reactor, where the extracted fatty acids were decarboxylated into saturated alkanes. The result is an enriched alkane stream that can be recycled for continuous extractions. Complete conversion of C(12) fatty acids extracted from culture to alkanes has been demonstrated yielding a concentration of 0.44 g L(-1) (culture volume) undecane."
Multi-dimensional gene target search for improving lycopene biosynthesis in Escherichia coli,"Jin, Y. S. and G. Stephanopoulos",Metab Eng,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2007.03.003,"Identification of multiple gene targets that exhibit different modes of action toward a desired phenotype is a crucial step in strain improvement. Target identification methods based on traceable genetic perturbations and stoichiometric modeling have been employed before for the mining of putative overexpression and knock-out targets. Most search methods are sequential and, as such, quite limited in the space they can explore. In this study, we investigate a multi-dimensional search approach whereby unknown interactions of gene targets identified by different search methods are assessed by employing orthogonal search strategies. To this end, we combined knock-out and overexpression gene targets, identified through systematic and combinatorial approaches, respectively, in order to improve lycopene production in Escherichia coli. Specifically, we first identified multiple overexpression targets by screening genomic libraries of E. coli in a sequential-iterative manner. Targets so identified confirmed previously amplified genes in the non-mevalonate pathway (dxs and idi) and some regulatory genes (rpoS and appY). Additionally, this method revealed novel gene targets (yjiD, ycgW, yhbL, purDH, and yggT). A two-dimensional search was subsequently undertaken, whereby the selected overexpression targets were combined with the knock-out targets predicted by stoichiometric modeling. All combinations of single (rpoS, appY, yjiD, ycgW, and yhbL), double (yjiD-ycgW) and triple (yjiD-ycgW-yhbL) overexpressions with four gene deletion backgrounds, including single (delta gdhA, or delta aceE), double (delta gdhA delta aceE), and triple (delta gdhA delta aceE delta fdhF) knockouts, were constructed and evaluated for lycopene production. Investigation of the metabolic landscape spanned by these 40 strains identified the best-engineered strain (T5(P)-dxs, T5(P)-idi, rrnB(P)-yjiD-ycgW, delta gdh delta aceE delta fdhF, pACLYC), which accumulated 16,000 ppm (16 mg/g cell) of lycopene within 24 h in a batch shake flask with 5 g/L of glucose in M9 minimal medium."
Combining treatments to improve the fermentation of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysates by ethanologenic Escherichia coli LY180,"Geddes, R., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.03.141,"Inhibitory side products from dilute acid pretreatment is a major challenge for conversion of lignocellulose into ethanol. Six strategies to detoxify sugarcane hydrolysates were investigated alone, and in combinations (vacuum evaporation of volatiles, high pH treatment with ammonia, laccase, bisulfite, microaeration, and inoculum size). High pH was the most beneficial single treatment, increasing the minimum inhibitory concentration (measured by ethanol production) from 15% (control) to 70% hydrolysate. Combining treatments provided incremental improvements, consistent with different modes of action and multiple inhibitory compounds. Screening toxicity using tube cultures proved to be an excellent predictor of relative performance in pH-controlled fermenters. A combination of treatments (vacuum evaporation, laccase, high pH, bisulfite, microaeration) completely eliminated all inhibitory activity present in hydrolysate. With this combination, fermentation of hemicellulose sugars (90% hydrolysate) to ethanol was complete within 48 h, identical to the fermentation of laboratory xylose (50 g/L) in AM1 mineral salts medium (without hydrolysate)."
Overproduction of Native and Click-able Colanic Acid Slime from Engineered Escherichia coli,"Sadler, J. C., et al.",JACS Au,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.2c00583,"The fundamental biology and application of bacterial exopolysaccharides is gaining increasing attention. However, current synthetic biology efforts to produce the major component of Escherichia sp. slime, colanic acid, and functional derivatives thereof have been limited. Herein, we report the overproduction of colanic acid (up to 1.32 g/L) from d-glucose in an engineered strain of Escherichia coli JM109. Furthermore, we report that chemically synthesized l-fucose analogues containing an azide motif can be metabolically incorporated into the slime layer via a heterologous fucose salvage pathway from Bacteroides sp. and used in a click reaction to attach an organic cargo to the cell surface. This molecular-engineered biopolymer has potential as a new tool for use in chemical, biological, and materials research."
Enhancing thermo-induced recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli by temperature oscillations and post-induction nutrient feeding strategies,"Caspeta, L., et al.",J Biotechnol,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.06.001,"Traditional strategies for production of thermo-induced recombinant protein in Escherichia coli consist of a two-phase culture, with an initial growth stage at low temperature (commonly 30 degrees C) followed by a production stage where temperature is increased stepwise (commonly up to 42 degrees C). A disadvantage of such strategies is that growth is inhibited upon temperature increase, limiting the duration of the production stage and consequently limiting recombinant protein production. In this work, a novel oscillatory thermo-induction strategy, consisting on temperature fluctuations between 37 and 42 degrees C or 30 and 42 degrees C, was tested for improving recombinant protein production. In addition, the induction schemes were combined with one of three different nutrient feeding strategies: two exponential and one linear. Recombinant human preproinsulin (HPPI), produced under control of the lambdaP(L)-cI857 system in the E. coli BL21 strain, was used as the model protein. Compared to the conventional induction scheme at constant temperature (42 degrees C), longer productive times were attained under oscillatory induction, which resulted in a 1.3- to 1.7-fold increase in maximum HPPI concentration. Temperature oscillations led to a 2.3- to 4.0-fold increase in biomass accumulation and a decrease of 48-62% in the concentration of organic acids, compared to conventional induction. Under constant induction, growth ceased upon temperature increase and the maximum concentration of HPPI was 3.9 g/L, regardless of the post-induction feeding strategy used. In comparison, the combination of temperature oscillations and a high nutrient-feeding rate allowed sustained growth after induction and reaching up to 5.8 g/L of HPPI."
Production and characterization of poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate) from recombinant Escherichia coli grown on cheap renewable carbon substrates,"Fonseca, G. G., et al.",Waste Manag Res,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242X07088443,"Although the biopolymer poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate), P[3HB], presents physicochemical properties that make it an alternative material to conventional plastics, its biotechnological production is quite expensive. As carbon substrates contribute greatly to P[3HB] production cost, the utilization of a cheaper carbon substrate and less demanding micro-organisms should decrease its cost. In the present study a 2(3) factorial experimental design was applied, aiming to evaluate the effects of using hydrolysed corn starch (HCS) and soybean oil (SBO) as carbon substrates, and cheese whey (CW) supplementation in the mineral medium (MM) on the responses, cell dried weigh (DCW), percentage P[3HB] and mass P[3HB] by recombinant Escherichia coli strains JM101 and DH10B, containing the P[3HB] synthase genes from Cupriavidus necator (ex-Ralstonia eutropha). The analysis of effects indicated that the substrates and the supplement and their interactions had positive effect on CDW. Statistically generated equations showed that, at the highest concentrations of HCS, SO and CW, theoretically it should be possible to produce about 2 g L(- 1) DCW, accumulating 50% P[3HB], in both strains. To complement this study, the strain that presented the best results was cultivated in MM added to HCS, SBO and CW (in best composition observed) and complex medium (CM) to compare the obtained P[3HB] in terms of physicochemical parameters. The obtained results showed that the P[3HB] production in MM (1.29 g L( -1)) was approximately 20% lower than in CM (1.63 g L(- 1)) however, this difference can be compensated by the lower cost of the MM achieved by the use of cheap renewable carbon sources. Moreover, using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analyses, it was observed that the polymer produced in MM was the one which presented physicochemical properties (Tg and Tf) that were more similar to those found in the literature for P[3HB]."
Combinatorial synthetic pathway fine-tuning and cofactor regeneration for metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli significantly improve production of D-glucaric acid,"Su, H. H., et al.",N Biotechnol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2020.03.004,"D-glucaric acid (GA) has been identified as among promising biotechnological alternatives to oil-based chemicals. GA and its derivatives are widely used in food additives, dietary supplements, drugs, detergents, corrosion inhibitors and biodegradable materials. The increasing availability of a GA market is improving the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of various biosynthetic pathways. In this study, an engineered Escherichia coli strain GA10 was constructed by systematic metabolic engineering. This involved redirecting metabolic flux into the GA biosynthetic pathways, blocking the conversion pathways of d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and GA into by-products, introducing an in situ NAD(+) regeneration system and fine-tuning the activity of the key enzyme, myo-inositol oxygenase (Miox). Subsequently, the culture medium was optimized to achieve the best performance of the GA10 strain. GA was produced at 5.35â¯g/L (extracellular and intracellular), with a maximized yield of approximately 0.46â¯mol/mol on d-glucose and glycerol, by batch fermentation. This work demonstrates efficient biosynthetic pathways of GA in E. coli by metabolic engineering and should accelerate the application of GA biosynthetic pathways in industrial processes."

During dual-phase fermentations, initial aerobic growth facilitated subsequent anaerobic succinate production, with a final succinate concentration of 18.88 g L(-1) and a yield of 0.96 g g(-1) total sugar after 24 h of anaerobic fermentation. The high succinate yield from sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate demonstrated a great potential application of renewable biomass as a feedstock for the economical production of succinate using metabolically engineered E. coli."

G., et al.",J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.815492,"The impact of suspended TiO2 particles on the efficiency of UV inactivation of E. coli by XeBr excilamp (282 nm) was assessed using direct and integrating sphere spectroscopy for absorbance measurements in the calculations of UV doses. Complete disinfection (no quantifiable E. coli colonies) was observed at 30 (0.25 g/L of TiO2) and 40 mJ/cm(2) (0.1 g/L of TiO2), whereas UV alone and the treatment in the presence of 0.5 g/L of TiO2 produced tailing in the dose-response curves. The optimum concentration of TiO2 was found to be 0.25 g/L, which correlates with the highest *OH exposure (CT value) and steady state concentration of *OH.

Rerouting carbon flux for optimized biosynthesis of mesaconate in Escherichia coli,"Wang, J., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9135-x,"Mesaconate, a branched unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, has drawn great interest because of its versatile applications. In this work, we optimized the fermentation efficiency of Escherichia coli to produce mesaconate from glucose. We first drove the carbon flux to 2-ketoglutarate by overexpressing genes involved in TCA precursor pathway and anaplerotic pathways. Then, to increase the pool of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), an upstream precursor for 2-ketoglutarate, the phosphotransferase system (PTS) of E. coli was inactivated by deleting glucose PTS permease and the import of glucose was altered by overexpressing galactose/H(+) symporter GalP. Further, production optimization was achieved by deleting a class I fumarase (FumA) to block the hydration of mesaconate. Finally, we overexpressed PEP synthase (PpsA) to increase the availability of phosphoenolpyruvate and accelerate the production of mesaconate. These genetic modifications led to mesaconate production with a titer of 23.1 g L(-1) and a yield of 0.46 g g(-1) glucose (64% of the theoretical maximum). This work demonstrates the possibility of engineering a highly efficient bacteria strain that converts glucose into mesaconate with promising titer, rate, and yield."

Then, the endogenous NR degradation pathway was detected, and the genes (rihA, rihB, and rihC) involved in NR degradation were knocked out, which enabled NR biosynthesis. In addition, the important role of the signal peptide of UshA in NR transport had been confirmed. Subsequently, nitrile hydratase was introduced to achieve the conversion of 3-cyanopyridine to NR. Finally, the NR titer reached 25.6 and 29.8 g/L with nicotinamide and 3-cyanopyridine, respectively, as substrates in a 5-L bioreactor, the efficient biosynthesis of NR in E. coli by using nicotinamide and 3-cyanopyridine."

In the constructed BT biosynthesis pathway from xylose in Escherichia coli, the xylose dehydrogenase (Xdh) and the benzoylformate decarboxylase (MdlC) are heterologous enzymes and the activity of MdlC is the key limiting factor for BT production. In this study, six chaperone protein systems were introduced into the engineered E. coli harboring the recombinant BT pathway. The chaperone GroES-GroEL was beneficial to Xdh activity but had a negative effect on MdlC activity and BT titer. The plasmid pTf16 containing the tig gene (trigger factor) was beneficial to Xdh and MdlC activities and improved the BT titer from 0.42 to 0.56 g/l from 20 g/l xylose. However, co-expression of trigger factor and GroES-GroEL simultaneously reduced the activity of MdlC and had no effect on the BT production. The plasmid pKJE7 harboring dnaK-dnaJ-grpE showed significant negative effects on these enzyme activities and cell growth, leading to completely restrained the BT production. Similarly, co-expression of DnaKJ-GrpPE and GroES-GroEL simultaneously reduced Xdh and MdlC activities and decreased the BT titer by 45.2 %. The BT production of the engineered E. coli harboring pTf16 was further improved to the highest level at 1.01 g/l under pH control (pH 7). This work showed the potential application of chaperone proteins in microorganism engineering to get high production of target compounds as an effective and valuable tool."
High production of ectoine from aspartate and glycerol by use of whole-cell biocatalysis in recombinant Escherichia coli,"He, Y. Z., et al.",Microb Cell Fact,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-015-0238-0,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the compatible solute 1, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid (ectoine) has attracted considerable interest due to its great potential as a protecting agent. To overcome the drawbacks of high salinity in the traditional bioprocess of ectoine using halophilic bacteria, various attempts have been made to engineer ectoine biosynthesis in nonhalophilic bacteria. Unfortunately, the yields of ectoine in these producers are still low and hardly meet the demands of large scale production. In this paper, the whole-cell biocatalytic process using aspartate and glycerol as substrates was tried for high production of ectoine in nonhalophilic bacteria. RESULTS: The ectoine genes ectABC from the halophilic bacterium Halomonas elongata were successfully introduced into Escherichia coli K-12 strain BW25113 under the arabinose-inducible promoter. To our delight, a large amount of ectoine was synthesized and excreted into the medium during the course of whole-cell biocatalysis, when using aspartate and glycerol as the direct substrates. At the low cell density of 5 OD/mL in flask, under the optimal conditions (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 100 mM sodium aspartate, 100 mM KCl and 100 mM glycerol), the concentration of extracellular ectoine was increased to 2.67 mg/mL. At the high cell density of 20 OD/mL in fermentor, a maximum titre of 25.1 g/L ectoine was achieved in 24 h. Meanwhile, the biomass productivity of ectoine is as high as 4048 mg per gram dry cell weight (g DCW)(-1), which is the highest value ever reported. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the same batch of cells could be used for at least three rounds. Finally, a total yield of 63.4 g ectoine was obtained using one litre cells. CONCLUSION: Using aspartate and glycerol as the direct substrates, high production of ectoine was achieved by the whole-cell biocatalysis in recombinant E. coli. Multiple rounds of whole-cell biocatalysis were established to further improve the production of ectoine. Our study herein provided a feasible biosynthesis process of ectoine with potential applications in large-scale industrial production."
Engineering Escherichia coli for cost-effective production of medium-chain fatty acids from soy whey using an optimized galactose-based autoinduction system,"Wang, Z., et al.",Bioresour Technol,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2023.130145,"Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are essential chemical feedstocks. Microbial production of MCFAs offers an attractive alternative to conventional methods, but the costly media and external inducers limit its practical application. To address this issue and make MCFA production more cost-effective, an E.coli platform was developed using soy whey as a medium and galactose as an autoinducer. We first designed an efficient, stringent, homogeneous, and robust galactose-based autoinduction system for the expression of pathway enzymes by rationally engineering the promoter of the galactose-proton symporter (GalP). Subsequently, the intracellular acetyl-CoA availability and NADH regeneration were enhanced to improve the reversal of the beta-oxidation cycle. The resulting strain yielded 8.20 g/L and 16.42 g/L MCFA in pH-controlled batch fermentation and fed-batch fermentation with glucose added using soy whey as medium, respectively. This study provided a cost-effective and promising platform for MCFA production, as well as future strain development for other value-added chemicals production."

Inoculation of cells in low pH medium was required for the derepression of the CA regulon, another indispensable requirement was the use of high copy number plasmid for over-expression of the heterologous polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis pathway in S17-3. In addition, S173-H exhibited superior growth performance in LBG, the maximal cell density (OD(600)) of cultures reached 40.0, far exceeding that of any known E. coli strains cultivated under similar conditions. Genomic data mining and transcriptional analysis hinted that the persistent growth or CA production might be modulated by interplaying regulation networks that signal the level of messenger substrate, acetyl-CoA or acetylphosphate. Depletion of these messenger substrates may be triggered by efficient PHB biosynthesis that links to enhanced capability in NADPH regeneration in S17-3, due to mutations on loci at pgi, csrA, or other sites."

The mae(+) recombinants were obtained by recombineering-based genomic integration of Pchap-mae, Ptac-mae and Ppdc-mae sequences. The Ppdc promoter showed the highest expression of malic enzyme and the Pchap the lowest. However, cell growth was limited in mae(+) recombinant containing Ppdc promoter. The metabolic analysis showed the highest level of malic acid in Ppdc-mae recombinant (2.84 g/L), which was about eight times higher than that in the wild type strain. The study showed that these three promoters can be used to produce organic acids in Z. mobilis."

We performed high-efficiency utilization of corncobs for beta-farnesene production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation with an optimized Escherichia coli strain. First, we developed a recycling strategy for both corncob pretreatment and cellulose hydrolysis, which saved great amounts of pretreatment reagents and presented a 96.83% cellulose conversion rate into glucose. However, the corncob hydrolysate strongly repressed cell growth and beta-farnesene production, being caused by high-concentrated citrate. Through expressing a heterologous ATP citrate lyase and screening for a suitable expression host, an optimized strain was constructed that produced beta-farnesene at 4.06 g/L after 48 h in a 5 L fermenter, representing an approximately 2.3-fold increase over the initial strain. Therefore, the proposed strategy about the recycling process and repression elimination was successful and suitable for the production of lignocellulosic-based beta-farnesene, which can be further studied to scale up for industrialization."

The CPPS and KS from S. rebaudiana were functionally expressed in a heterologous host E. coli. Furthermore, in order to enhance ent-kaurene production in E. coli, six geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPS) from various microorganisms and eight strains of E. coli as host were compared by measuring ent-kaurene production. The highest ent-kaurene production of approximately 41.1mg/L was demonstrated in E. coli strain MG1655 co-expressing synthetic CPPS-KS module and GGPPS from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The ent-kaurene production was further increased up to 179.6 mg/L by overexpression of the three key enzymes for isoprenoid precursor, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (IspA) and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) from E. coli.

In this study, we engineered a functional heparosan synthesis pathway in Bacillus megaterium by the expression of E. coli K5 kfiC and kfiA glycosyltransferase genes. Upregulation of individual UDP-sugar precursor pathway genes enhanced the heparosan production, indicating that UDP-precursor sugar concentrations were limiting the biosynthesis. The engineered B. megaterium yielded a maximum heparosan concentration of 394 mg/L in batch bioreactor. The heparosan titer was further increased to 1.32 g/L in fed-batch fermentation. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that the chemical structure of B. megaterium derived heparosan was identical to E. coli K5 heparosan. The heparosan molecular weight varied from 31 to 60 kDa, indicating its potential as a precursor for chemoenzymatic heparin biosynthesis.

Optimizing a Fed-Batch High-Density Fermentation Process for Medium Chain-Length Poly(3-Hydroxyalkanoates) in Escherichia coli,"Scheel, R. A., et al.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2021.618259,"Production of medium chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) [PHA] polymers with tightly defined compositions is an important area of research to expand the application and improve the properties of these promising biobased and biodegradable materials. PHA polymers with homopolymeric or defined compositions exhibit attractive material properties such as increased flexibility and elasticity relative to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [PHB] however, these polymers are difficult to biosynthesize in native PHA-producing organisms, and there is a paucity of research toward developing high-density cultivation methods while retaining compositional control. In this study, we developed and optimized a fed-batch fermentation process in a stirred tank reactor, beginning with the biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxydecanoate) [PHD] from decanoic acid by beta-oxidation deficient recombinant Escherichia coli LSBJ using glucose as a co-substrate solely for growth. Bacteria were cultured in two stages, a biomass accumulation stage (37 degrees C, pH 7.0) with glucose as the primary carbon source and a PHA biosynthesis stage (30 degrees C, pH 8.0) with co-feeding of glucose and a fatty acid. Through iterative optimizations of semi-defined media composition and glucose feed rate, 6.0 g of decanoic acid was converted to PHD with an 87.5% molar yield (4.54 g L(-1)). Stepwise increases in the amount of decanoic acid fed during the fermentation correlated with an increase in PHD, resulting in a final decanoic acid feed of 25 g converted to PHD at a yield of 89.4% (20.1 g L(-1), 0.42 g L(-1) h(-1)), at which point foaming became uncontrollable. Hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, 10-undecenoic acid, and 10-bromodecanoic acid were all individually supplemented at 20 g each and successfully polymerized with yields ranging from 66.8 to 99.0% (9.24 to 18.2 g L(-1)). Using this bioreactor strategy, co-fatty acid feeds of octanoic acid/decanoic acid and octanoic acid/10-azidodecanoic acid (8:2 mol ratio each) resulted in the production of their respective copolymers at nearly the same ratio and at high yield, demonstrating that these methods can be used to control PHA copolymer composition."
Dehydratase mediated 1-propanol production in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli,"Jain, R. and Y. Yan",Microb Cell Fact,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-10-97,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, the question of meeting the global energy demand is of great importance in the near future. As an effective solution, production of higher alcohols from renewable sources by microorganisms has been proposed to address both energy crisis and environmental concerns. Higher alcohols contain more than two carbon atoms and have better physiochemical properties than ethanol as fuel substitutes. RESULTS: We designed a novel 1-propanol metabolic pathway by expanding the well-known 1,2-propanediol pathway with two more enzymatic steps catalyzed by a 1,2-propanediol dehydratase and an alcohol dehydrogenase. In order to engineer the pathway into E. coli, we evaluated the activities of eight different methylglyoxal synthases which play crucial roles in shunting carbon flux from glycolysis towards 1-propanol biosynthesis, as well as two secondary alcohol dehydrogenases of different origins that reduce both methylglyoxal and hydroxyacetone. It is evident from our results that the most active enzymes are the methylglyoxal synthase from Bacillus subtilis and the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae, encoded by mgsA and budC respectively. With the expression of these two genes and the E. coli ydjG encoding methylglyoxal reductase, we achieved the production of 1,2-propanediol at 0.8 g/L in shake flask experiments. We then characterized the catalytic efficiency of three different diol dehydratases on 1,2-propanediol and identified the optimal one as the 1,2-propanediol dehydratase from Klebsiella oxytoca, encoded by the operon ppdABC. Co-expressing this enzyme with the above 1,2-propanediol pathway in wild type E. coli resulted in the production of 1-propanol at a titer of 0.25 g/L. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully established a new pathway for 1-propanol production by shunting the carbon flux from glycolysis. To our knowledge, it is the first time that this pathway has been utilized to produce 1-propanol in E. coli. The work presented here forms a basis for further improvement in production. We speculate that dragging more carbon flux towards methylglyoxal by manipulating glycolytic pathway and eliminating competing pathways such as lactate generation can further enhance the production of 1-propanol."
CRISPRi/dCpf1-mediated dynamic metabolic switch to enhance butenoic acid production in Escherichia coli,"Ji, X., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10610-2,"Butenoic acid is a short-chain unsaturated fatty acid and important precursor for pharmaceutical and other applications. Heterologous thioesterases are able to convert a fatty acid biosynthesis intermediate in Escherichia coli to butenoic acid. In order to acquire high titer and yield of the product, dynamically switching the metabolic flux from fatty acid biosynthesis pathway to butenoic acid is critical after achieving enough cell mass of the host. A previous developed switch for butenoic acid fermentation is based on triclosan molecule as the FabI inhibitor in the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle. However, triclosan is toxic to human, which may limit its pharmaceutical application. Alternatively, we here purposed a nontoxic switch of carbon flux by harnessing recently developed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) approach. In our work, we constructed a CRISPRi/dCpf1-mediated dynamic metabolic switch to separate the host growth and production phase via switching the expression of the fabI gene in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. After optimizing the programmable targets, the CRISPRi-based switch boosted the titer of butenoic acid by 6-fold (1.41 g/L) in fed-batch fermentation. Our work supported that the CRISPRi/dCpf1 switch could replace triclosan-based switch as a nontoxic switch for butenoic acid production, and outcompeted the later switch in the biomass accumulation of the host cell. Moreover, the CRISPRi/dCpf1 system was integrated into the chromosome of the host to improve its genetic stability for long-term fermentation and other applications.Key Points* A programmable metabolic switch was developed to replace the toxic chemical switch to separate the growth phase and production phase of the butenoic acid.* The programmable CRISPRi/dCpf1 switch was efficiently and stably integrated into the host genome to increase their genetic stability during fermentation.* The optimized metabolic switch simultaneously increased the host biomass and butenoic acid titer, and solved the paradox of the competition between growth and production."
Metabolic Engineering of Escherichia coli for High-Level Production of (R)-Acetoin from Low-Cost Raw Materials,"Diao, M., et al.",Microorganisms,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11010203,"Acetoin is an important four-carbon platform chemical with versatile applications. Optically pure (R)-acetoin is more valuable than the racemate as it can be applied in the asymmetric synthesis of optically active alpha-hydroxy ketone derivatives, pharmaceuticals, and liquid crystal composites. As a cytotoxic solvent, acetoin at high concentrations severely limits culture performance and impedes the acetoin yield of cell factories. In this study, putative genes that may improve the resistance to acetoin for Escherichia coli were screened. To obtain a high-producing strain, the identified acetoin-resistance gene was overexpressed, and the synthetic pathway of (R)-acetoin was strengthened by optimizing the copy number of the key genes. The engineered E. coli strain GXASR-49RSF produced 81.62 g/L (R)-acetoin with an enantiomeric purity of 96.5% in the fed-batch fermentation using non-food raw materials in a 3-L fermenter. Combining the systematic approach developed in this study with the use of low-cost feedstock showed great potential for (R)-acetoin production via this cost-effective biotechnological process."
Enhanced production of polysialic acid by metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli,"Chen, F., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6391-x,"A number of reports have described the production of polysialic acid (PSA), focusing on the fermentation and purification of PSA. However, little work has been done to strengthen the synthetic pathway of PSA to improve PSA production. In this study, an efficient process for enhanced production of PSA using a recombinant Escherichia coli strain was developed. To improve the PSA production efficiency, the key enzymes of PSA synthetic pathway were overexpressed separately or in combination, including N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac) 7-O(or 9-O)-acetyltransferase (NeuD), CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (NeuA), and alpha-Neu5Ac alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase (NeuS). The PSA production was significantly improved by coexpression of NeuD and NeuA. In terms of the efficiency, NeuD was considered as the most important factor. Secondly, the competing pathway of intermediate Neu5Ac was blocked by nanA deletion. The efficient PSA-producing strain E. coli SA9DeltananA/pDB1S-DA was constructed, and 16.15 +/- 1.45 g/L PSA was obtained in the fed-batch culture. The production of PSA by engineered strain was increased by 85 % compared to the original strain. These results provide evidence for improvement of PSA production by regulation of the PSA biosynthetic pathway. The high productivity of our process should make it a promising cost-effective resource for PSA."
Continuous removal of the model pharmaceutical chloroquine from water using melanin-covered Escherichia coli in a membrane bioreactor,"Lindroos, M., et al.",J Hazard Mater,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.081,"Environmental release and accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products is a global concern in view of increased awareness of ecotoxicological effects. Adsorbent properties make the biopolymer melanin an interesting alternative to remove micropollutants from water. Recently, tyrosinase-surface-displaying Escherichia coli was shown to be an interesting self-replicating production system for melanin-covered cells for batch-wise absorption of the model pharmaceutical chloroquine. This work explores the suitability of these melanin-covered E. coli for the continuous removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. A continuous-flow membrane bioreactor containing melanized E. coli cells was used for adsorption of chloroquine from the influent until saturation and subsequent regeneration. At a low loading of cells (10 g/L) and high influent concentration of chloroquine (0.1 mM), chloroquine adsorbed until saturation after 26 +/- 2 treated reactor volumes (39 +/- 3 L). The average effluent concentration during the first 20 h was 0.0018 mM, corresponding to 98.2% removal. Up to 140 +/- 6 mg chloroquine bound per gram of cells following mixed homo- and heterogeneous adsorption kinetics. In situ low-pH regeneration released all chloroquine without apparent capacity loss over three consecutive cycles. This shows the potential of melanized cells for treatment of conventional wastewater or highly concentrated upstream sources such as hospitals or manufacturing sites."
Plasmid-Free System and Modular Design for Efficient 5-Aminolevulinic Acid Production by Engineered Escherichia coli,"Shih, I. T., et al.",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-021-03571-3,"5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an essential intermediate for many organisms and has been considered for the applications of medical especially in photodynamic therapy of cancer recently. However, ALA production via chemical approach is complicated hence, microbial manufacturing has received more attentions. In this study, a modular design to simultaneously express ALA synthase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RshemA), a non-specific ALA exporter (RhtA), and chaperones was first developed and discussed. The ALA production was significantly increased by coexpressing RhtA and RshemA. Besides, ALA was enhanced by the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) which was supplied by expressing genes of pdxK and pdxY or direct addition. However, inclusion bodies of RshemA served as an obstacle thus, chaperones DnaK and GroELS were introduced to reform the conformation of proteins and successfully improved ALA production. Finally, a plasmid-free strain RrGI, as the robust chassis, was established and a 6.23-fold enhancement on ALA biosynthesis and led to 7.47 g/L titer and 0.588 g/L/h productivity under the optimal cultural condition."
De novo Synthesis of 2-phenylethanol from Glucose by Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli,"Wang, G., et al.",J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/jimb/kuac026,"2-Phenylethanol (2- PE) is an aromatic alcohol with wide applications, but there is still no efficient microbial cell factory for 2-PE based on Escherichia coli. In this study, we constructed a metabolically engineered E. coli capable of de novo synthesis of 2-PE from glucose. Firstly, the heterologous styrene-derived and Ehrlich pathways were individually constructed in an L-Phe producer. The results showed that the Ehrlich pathway was better suited to the host than the styrene-derived pathway, resulting in a higher 2-PE titer of approximately 0.76 +/- 0.02 g/L after 72 h of shake flask fermentation. Furthermore, the phenylacetic acid synthase encoded by feaB was deleted to decrease the consumption of 2-phenylacetaldehyde, and the 2-PE titer increased to 1.75 +/- 0.08 g/L. As phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is an important precursor for L-Phe synthesis, both the crr and pykF genes were knocked out, leading to approximately 35% increase of the 2-PE titer, which reached 2.36 +/- 0.06 g/L. Finally, a plasmid-free engineered strain was constructed based on the Ehrlich pathway by integrating multiple ARO10 cassettes (encoding phenylpyruvate decarboxylases) and overexpressing the yjgB gene. The engineered strain produced 2.28 +/- 0.20 g/L of 2-PE with a yield of 0.076 g/g glucose and productivity of 0.048 g/L/h. To our best knowledge, this is the highest titer and productivity ever reported for the de novo synthesis of 2-PE in E. coli. In a 5-L fermenter, the 2-PE titer reached 2.15 g/L after 32 h of fermentation, suggesting that the strain has the potential to efficiently produce higher 2-PE titers following further fermentation optimization."
"Reduction of acetate synthesis, enhanced arginine export, and supply of precursors, cofactors, and energy for improved synthesis of L-arginine by Escherichia coli","Wang, H. D., et al.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-023-12532-1,"L-arginine (L-Arg) is a semi-essential amino acid with many important physiological functions. However, achieving efficient manufacture of L-Arg on an industrial scale using Escherichia coli (E. coli) remains a major challenge. In previous studies, we constructed a strain of E. coli A7, which had good L-Arg production capacity. In this study, E. coli A7 was further modified, and E. coli A21 with more efficient L-Arg production capacity was obtained. Firstly, we reduced the acetate accumulation of strain A7 by weakening the poxB gene and overexpressing acs gene. Secondly, we improved the L-Arg transport efficiency of strains by overexpressing the lysE gene from Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum). Finally, we enhanced the supplies of precursors for the synthesis of L-Arg and optimized the supplies of cofactor NADPH and energy ATP in strain. After fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor, the L-Arg titer of strain A21 was found to be 89.7 g/L. The productivity was 1.495 g/(L.h) and the glucose yield was 0.377 g/g. Our study further narrowed the titer gap between E. coli and C. glutamicum in the synthesis of L-Arg. In all recent studies on the L-Arg production by E. coli, this was the highest titer recorded. In conclusion, our study further promotes the efficient mass synthesis of L-Arg by E. coli. KEY POINTS: * The acetate accumulation of starting strain A7 was decreased. * Overexpression of gene lysE of C. glutamicum enhanced L-Arg transport in strain A10. * Enhance the supplies of precursors for the synthesis of L-Arg and optimize the supplies of cofactor NADPH and energy ATP. Finally, Strain A21 was detected to have an L-Arg titer of 89.7 g/L in a 5-L bioreactor."
